# Pane Runtime Architecture

## Problem

Agent Studio is a **workspace for agent-assisted development** — an agent orchestration platform where terminal agents (Claude, Codex, aider) are the primary drivers and non-terminal panes (diff viewers, PR reviewers, code viewers) exist for human observation and control. This is the **inverse of Cursor**: agents drive the workspace, users observe and orchestrate.

The current Ghostty integration handles 12 of 40+ C API actions, uses `DispatchQueue.main.async` and `NotificationCenter` for event dispatch, and has no typed event contract. Non-terminal pane types (webview, diff viewer) have no runtime abstraction. There is no bidirectional communication system, no event batching, and no temporal coordination for multi-agent workflows.

This document defines the pane runtime communication architecture: how panes of all types produce events, receive commands, and coordinate through the workspace.

> **Implementation status note:** This document includes both shipped contracts and forward-defined target contracts. For ticket-by-ticket implementation state, use the mapping ledger in `docs/plans/2026-02-21-pane-runtime-luna-295-luna-325-mapping.md`. For the EventBus coordination design (actor fan-out, boundary actors, data flow per contract), see [Pane Runtime EventBus Design](pane_runtime_eventbus_design.md).

### Jobs This Architecture Solves

> JTBD 1-8 and Pain Points P1-P8 are defined in [JTBD & Requirements](jtbd_and_requirements.md). This table maps the subset addressed by the pane runtime architecture.

| JTBD | How This Architecture Addresses It |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| **JTBD 1 — Context tracking** | Every event carries pane identity (paneId, worktreeId, agentType, CWD). Metadata changes from terminal CWD, webview URL, or diff file paths all flow through typed events with source identity. |
| **JTBD 2 — Ephemeral pane management** | Lifecycle state machine (`created → ready → draining → terminated`) with explicit shutdown and unfinished-command reporting. No orphaned runtimes, no ghost events. |
| **JTBD 3 — Agent-agnostic** | `PaneRuntime` protocol is pane-type-agnostic. Terminal, webview, diff, and future editors all conform to the same contract. Agents are processes in terminals; the runtime contract doesn't care which agent. |
| **JTBD 4 — Cross-project organization** | Event stream carries worktreeId and repo context on every event. Dynamic views can subscribe and filter by any metadata dimension. |
| **JTBD 5 — Dynamic composition** | Filesystem watcher + artifact events feed dynamic views with live grouping data. New changesets trigger view recomputation. |
| **JTBD 6 — Stay in flow** | Notifications route to exact pane via paneId. Diff artifacts flow from terminal → diff pane → approval without leaving the workspace. Priority system ensures active pane events are never delayed by background noise. |

## Three Data Flow Planes

All data flow in the pane runtime architecture follows one of three planes. Every new feature, event, or interaction pattern should be classified into exactly one.

| Plane | Direction | Mechanism | Invariant |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Event plane** | Producers → EventBus → consumers | Runtimes (`@MainActor`) and boundary actors (FilesystemActor, GitWorkingDirectoryProjector, ForgeActor, ContainerActor) post `RuntimeEnvelope`s (3-tier: `SystemEnvelope`, `WorktreeEnvelope`, `PaneEnvelope`) to `EventBus`. `WorkspaceCacheCoordinator`, `NotificationReducer`, and future analytics subscribe from the bus independently. | One-way. Events never flow backward. Bus is dumb fan-out (`post()` + `subscribe()` only). See [EventBus Design](pane_runtime_eventbus_design.md) and [Workspace Data Architecture](workspace_data_architecture.md). |
| **Command plane** | User/system → coordinator → runtime | Coordinator dispatches `RuntimeCommand`s directly via `RuntimeRegistry` (`runtime.handleCommand(envelope)`). Command-plane calls to boundary actors (e.g., `forgeActor.refresh(repo:)`) are also direct. | Request-response. Commands never flow through the EventBus. |
| **UI plane** | Runtime → SwiftUI view | `@Observable` properties on each runtime, views bind directly. `@Observable` mutation happens synchronously on `@MainActor` **before** any bus post. | Synchronous, zero-overhead. UI is never stale relative to coordination consumers. Bus is for coordination, not UI state transport. |

**The multiplexing rule:** When a runtime processes a domain event (e.g., `titleChanged`), it writes `@Observable` state first (UI plane), then posts to the bus (event plane). Both happen, in that order. **Why this ordering is critical:** `@Observable` mutation is synchronous on `@MainActor` — SwiftUI views see the new state immediately on the current frame. The bus post is async (`await bus.post()`), meaning coordination consumers may process the event one or more frames later. If the bus post happened first, a coordination consumer could react to the event (e.g., update a tab bar label) before the runtime's own `@Observable` state reflected the change, creating a visible inconsistency. `@Observable` first guarantees the source-of-truth view is never stale relative to downstream consumers. The test for whether an event needs the bus: "Would any other component in the system care?" If yes → bus. If only the bound view cares → `@Observable` only.

**Why not three separate streams:** These three planes are **logical roles**, not three separate data structures. Separate control/state/data streams create an ordering hazard: a late-joining consumer can observe inconsistent state (e.g., seeing a loaded diff without knowing which terminal produced it). The event plane uses a single `AsyncStream` per runtime (posted to one `EventBus`) — not three separate streams. The planes describe what each data path *does*; the implementation shares infrastructure where ordering matters. See [D2](#d2-single-typed-event-stream-not-three-separate-planes) for the full rationale.

## Design Decisions

Each decision links to the user problem it solves and the alternatives considered.

### D1: Per-pane-type runtimes, not actor-per-pane

**User problem:** Users run 5-10 agents simultaneously. The system must handle concurrent events without one pane poisoning others (JTBD 4, P8).

**Decision:** One `@MainActor` runtime CLASS per pane type. One runtime INSTANCE per pane. `TerminalRuntime` is the class; each terminal pane gets its own instance. All instances share `@MainActor` (same thread, no async boundaries between them). Protocol is `async` from day one to preserve the actor upgrade path.

**Instance model:**

Runtime classes are grouped by **transport mechanism**, not by content type. Multiple content types share a single runtime class when their underlying transport is the same. This avoids duplicating 90% of lifecycle/event/command code across runtime classes that differ only in content semantics (which live in the frontend, not the Swift runtime layer).

```
RUNTIME CLASSES (one per transport):       CONTENT TYPES SERVED:
  TerminalRuntime                            .terminal
  BridgeRuntime                              .diff, .editor, .review, .agent, .plugin(...)
  WebviewRuntime                             .browser
  SwiftPaneRuntime                           .codeViewer, future native panes
```

```
INSTANCES (one per pane):
  TerminalRuntime[pane-A]     ← .terminal pane
  TerminalRuntime[pane-B]     ← .terminal pane
  BridgeRuntime[pane-C]       ← .diff pane (React app)
  BridgeRuntime[pane-D]       ← .editor pane (React app)
  WebviewRuntime[pane-E]      ← .browser pane
  SwiftPaneRuntime[pane-F]    ← .codeViewer pane
```

Adapters are shared — one per backend technology. Each adapter routes by surface/view ID to the correct runtime instance.

```
ADAPTERS (shared, one per backend technology):
  GhosttyAdapter  ──► routes by surfaceId ──► TerminalRuntime[pane-X]
  RPCRouter       ──► routes by paneId    ──► BridgeRuntime[pane-Y]
  WebKitDelegate  ──► routes by webViewId ──► WebviewRuntime[pane-Z]

RUNTIMES (per-pane, registered in RuntimeRegistry):
  RuntimeRegistry[pane-A] → TerminalRuntime instance
  RuntimeRegistry[pane-B] → TerminalRuntime instance
  RuntimeRegistry[pane-C] → BridgeRuntime instance
  RuntimeRegistry[pane-D] → BridgeRuntime instance
  RuntimeRegistry[pane-E] → WebviewRuntime instance
```

**Why transport-based, not content-based:** Bridge panes (diff, editor, review, agent) all share WKWebView + JSON-RPC transport. Having separate `DiffRuntime`, `EditorRuntime`, `ReviewRuntime` classes that are 90% identical lifecycle/event/command boilerplate is premature abstraction. The content-specific behavior (what hunks to show, what file to edit) lives in the React app — the Swift runtime only handles lifecycle, event transport, and command dispatch. `BridgeRuntime.contentType` distinguishes behavior where needed.

**Current code status note:** `PaneContent` currently persists `.bridgePanel(BridgePaneState)` and `.codeViewer(CodeViewerState)`. In current mapping, `.bridgePanel(panelKind: .diffViewer)` resolves to `PaneContentType.diff`; `.codeViewer` resolves to `PaneContentType.codeViewer`. `PaneContentType.editor/review/agent` are reserved routing kinds for upcoming bridge panel kinds.

**Why webview is separate from bridge:** Plain browser panes (`.browser`) use WKWebView for navigation but have NO JSON-RPC bridge, no push plans, no React app. Their transport is fundamentally simpler — WebKit navigation delegate events, not RPC messages. Merging them would force browser panes to carry bridge infrastructure they don't use.

**Why swift pane is separate:** Native AppKit/SwiftUI panes (`.codeViewer`) have no WebView at all. Their "adapter" is direct Swift method calls. A separate `SwiftPaneRuntime` keeps the WKWebView dependency out of native pane code.

**Why not actor-per-pane:** Swift actors impose async boundaries on every property access. For a macOS UI app where all state feeds `@Observable` views on the main thread, this adds overhead without matching benefit. `@MainActor` already provides thread safety.

**Actor migration path (honest cost):** The protocol is `async` from day one, which minimizes caller-side changes if a runtime is later moved to its own actor. However, `@MainActor` on the protocol itself and sync property access (`paneId`, `metadata`, `lifecycle`, `capabilities`, `snapshot()`) lock current conformers to main-actor isolation. Migrating to actor-per-pane would require: (1) removing `@MainActor` from the protocol, (2) making sync properties `async` or using `nonisolated`, (3) updating all callsites. This is a real migration cost — the protocol reduces it but does not eliminate it. Profile before deciding (>1000 events/sec sustained).

**MainActor processing budget:** Since `TerminalRuntime` is `@MainActor`, heavy processing of Ghostty output (regex searching, artifact extraction, log parsing) MUST be offloaded to the cooperative pool via `@concurrent nonisolated` helpers (Swift 6.2). `@concurrent` is only valid on nonisolated declarations (SE-0461), so helpers must opt out of actor isolation before opting into pool execution. Project convention is `@concurrent nonisolated static` helpers to avoid accidental `self`/actor-isolation capture. The runtime's event handler should be fast — classify the event, update `@Observable` state, emit the envelope. Anything that takes >1ms (string matching across scrollback, diff computation, file content hashing) must use `@concurrent nonisolated` to avoid UI stutters on the main thread. Prefer `@concurrent` over `Task.detached` (which strips priority and task-locals). Do NOT use plain `nonisolated async` expecting pool execution — it inherits caller isolation in Swift 6.2. See [Pane Runtime EventBus Design — Per-Pane Heavy Work](pane_runtime_eventbus_design.md#per-pane-heavy-work-concurrent) for the full pattern.

**Why not single coordinator handling all events:** Becomes a god object as pane types grow. Per-type runtimes have clear ownership, are testable in isolation, and scale with new pane types.

### D2: Single typed event stream, not three separate planes

**User problem:** When agent A finishes a task and a diff appears, the user needs to know which agent produced it, what repo it's in, and the diff content — all consistently, with no missing context (JTBD 6, P6).

**Decision:** One `PaneRuntimeEvent` enum carried on one `AsyncStream` per runtime, with per-source sequence numbers (`seq` is monotonic within a single source — pane, worktree watcher, or system). Cross-source ordering is best-effort via `timestamp`. Events cover lifecycle, terminal, browser, filesystem, artifact, and error cases.

**Why not three planes (control/state/data):** Separate streams create an ordering hazard: if control events ("diff generated") and state events ("diff pane loaded") travel on separate streams, a late-joining consumer can observe inconsistent state — seeing a loaded diff without knowing which terminal produced it. Single stream with per-source ordering eliminates this within a pane. Cross-source ordering relies on timestamps — sufficient for UI rendering and workflow matching, not for strict causal ordering.

**Cross-source workflow example:** Terminal agent finishes (`source: .pane(agentA)`, `GhosttyEvent.commandFinished`) → filesystem watcher detects changes (`source: .system(.builtin(.filesystemWatcher))` with `sourceFacets.worktreeId = wt1`, `FilesystemEvent.filesChanged`) → coordinator creates diff pane. These events come from different sources, so `seq` is independent. The coordinator uses `correlationId` to link the workflow chain and `timestamp` to order them. This is sufficient: the coordinator doesn't need strict causal ordering — it only needs "commandFinished happened, then files changed" which timestamps guarantee within clock precision.

**Clarification:** `@Observable` state for UI binding remains separate from the event stream. Terminal views bind directly to `runtime.searchState` or `runtime.scrollbarState` via `@Observable`. The event stream carries coordination events only — things the workspace or other panes need to react to.

### D3: @Observable for UI state, event stream for coordination

**User problem:** Terminal UI must update at 60fps for scrollbar, search, mouse cursor. Workspace must react to "command finished" within one frame. These have different performance profiles (JTBD 6).

**Decision:** Two consumption paths:
- **UI binding:** `@Observable` properties on the runtime, views bind directly. High-frequency, low-latency, no event bus overhead.
- **Coordination:** `PaneRuntimeEvent` stream with envelopes. Cross-pane workflows, notifications, artifact routing.

**Why:** A scrollbar position update at 60fps should not flow through the same pipeline as "command finished with exit code 0." Direct `@Observable` binding is zero-overhead for UI. The event stream handles what needs routing, ordering, and batching.

### D4: GhosttyEvent enum at FFI boundary for exhaustive capture

**User problem:** Agent Studio currently ignores 28+ Ghostty actions (progress, bell, search, scrollbar, command finish, config reload, etc.). Users can't see command duration, progress bars, or respond to terminal notifications (JTBD 6, P6).

**Decision:** Every `ghostty_action_tag_e` maps to a case in a Swift `GhosttyEvent` enum. The adapter's switch is exhaustive. Unhandled events map to `.unhandled(tag)` with explicit logging — never silently dropped.

**Why:** Compile-time guarantee that adding a new Ghostty action forces a handler decision. The enum IS the documentation of "what Ghostty can tell us." Silent drops are how the current 12/40 gap happened.

### D5: View / Controller / Runtime / Adapter layering

**User problem:** Ghostty C callbacks arrive on arbitrary threads with C types. The system must be safe under Swift 6 strict concurrency and testable without real Ghostty surfaces (JTBD 3). Multiple pane types (terminal, bridge, webview, native) each have a backend technology that needs lifecycle management and event translation.

**Decision:** Four-layer pipeline per pane type, plus a shared coordinator:

1. **View** — NSView subclass. Renders content, handles input. No lifecycle or domain logic. One instance per pane.
2. **Controller** — Per-pane lifecycle for the backend resource (WebKit page, RPC router, push plans). Owns transport-specific state. Not all pane types need a separate controller (terminal surfaces are managed by `SurfaceManager`).
3. **Runtime** — `PaneRuntime` conformer. Owns lifecycle state machine, `@Observable` UI state, event stream, command dispatch. Pure Swift, testable with mock adapters. One instance per pane.
4. **Adapter** — FFI/transport boundary. Translates platform types to Swift enums. Shared singleton per backend technology. `@Sendable` trampolines hop to `MainActor`. No domain logic.

```
VIEW (renders)          CONTROLLER (transport)     RUNTIME (PaneRuntime)        ADAPTER (boundary)
─────────────────────   ──────────────────────     ────────────────────────     ──────────────────
TerminalPaneMountView   SurfaceManager (shared)    TerminalRuntime              GhosttyAdapter
BridgePaneMountView     BridgePaneController       BridgeRuntime                RPCRouter
WebviewPaneMountView    WebviewPaneController      WebviewRuntime               WebKit delegate
SwiftPaneView           (direct Swift)             SwiftPaneRuntime             (none — direct calls)
```

**Layer responsibilities:**

| Layer | Owns | Does NOT own | Change driver |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|
| **View** | NSView, input handling, rendering | Lifecycle, state, events | Rendering technology |
| **Controller** | Backend resource (WebKit page, RPC, push plans) | Lifecycle state machine, event stream | Transport-specific behavior |
| **Runtime** | Lifecycle, `@Observable` state, event stream, command dispatch | Backend resource, view rendering | PaneRuntime protocol contract |
| **Adapter** | FFI/transport translation, routing to runtime instances | Domain logic, state | Backend technology API changes |

**Why controller and runtime are separate:** The controller owns the backend resource (WebKit page, RPC wiring). The runtime owns the PaneRuntime protocol surface (lifecycle, events, commands). Separating them means the runtime is testable without a real WebKit instance, and the controller can be reused across content types (one `BridgePaneController` class serves diff, editor, review, agent).

**5. Coordinator** — Cross-store sequencing. Routes commands to runtimes via `RuntimeRegistry`. Consumes coordination events. No pane-type-specific logic. See [PaneCoordinator](#architecture-overview).

### D6: Priority-aware event processing

**User problem:** When 5 agents are running, the active pane's "command finished" notification must not be delayed by background terminal telemetry (JTBD 6, P8).

**Decision:** Events self-classify as `critical` (never coalesced, immediate delivery) or `lossy` (batched on frame boundary, deduped by consolidation key). This is the **event classification** axis.

**Visibility tiers:** LUNA-295 defines a separate axis: `p0ActivePane → p1ActiveDrawer → p2VisibleActiveTab → p3Background`. This is a **delivery scheduling** concern — which pane's events get processed first when multiple events arrive in the same frame. The NotificationReducer resolves tier via an injected `VisibilityTierResolver` (coordinator-provided). Adding visibility tiers is additive — the event and envelope contracts are unchanged. See [Contract 12a: Visibility-Tier Scheduling](#contract-12a-visibility-tier-scheduling-luna-295) for the full specification.

### D7: Filesystem observation with batched artifact production

**User problem:** Agents edit 50 files in 2 seconds. The workspace needs to know "agent produced a changeset" without drowning in per-file events (JTBD 5, JTBD 6, P6).

**Decision:** `FilesystemActor` emits filesystem facts (`.filesChanged`) and watched-folder topology facts (`.repoDiscovered`, `.repoRemoved`) alongside worktree topology (`.worktreeRegistered`/`.worktreeUnregistered`). A separate `GitWorkingDirectoryProjector` subscribes to `.filesChanged` and emits derived git facts (`.snapshotChanged`, `.branchChanged`, `.originChanged`). Add Folder uses a direct watched-folder command to trigger the actor and receive a scan summary, but topology facts still flow through the bus fanout. `FilesystemActor` enforces debounce (500ms settle) and max latency (2s) so sustained writes still flush bounded batches.

**Enrichment pipeline context:** This filesystem observation is part of a sequential enrichment pipeline: `FilesystemActor → GitWorkingDirectoryProjector → ForgeActor → WorkspaceCacheCoordinator`. Each stage subscribes to the bus and produces enriched events. The full pipeline spec is in [Workspace Data Architecture](workspace_data_architecture.md).

**Primary sidebar identity contract (implemented):**
1. `GitWorkingDirectoryProjector` is the only origin producer. It emits:
   - `.originChanged(repoId:from:to:)` when a remote is resolved
   - `.originUnavailable(repoId:)` when local-only is explicitly confirmed
2. `WorkspaceCacheCoordinator` derives typed repo identity from git facts and writes `RepoEnrichment` as a discriminated union:
   - `.awaitingOrigin(repoId:)` while identity is still unresolved
   - `.resolvedLocal(repoId:identity:updatedAt:)` when no remote exists
   - `.resolvedRemote(repoId:raw:identity:updatedAt:)` when a remote is known
   - `raw` contains git facts (`origin`, `upstream`), `identity` contains projection fields (`groupKey`, `remoteSlug`, `organizationName`, `displayName`)
3. `RepoSidebarContentView` groups only resolved repos. `awaitingOrigin` repos render in the disabled `Scanning...` section until they graduate into resolved local or resolved remote groups.
4. `ForgeEvent.pullRequestCountsChanged(repoId:countsByBranch:)` is mapped by `(repoId, branch)` in `WorkspaceCacheCoordinator` to prevent cross-repo branch-name contamination (for example, two unrelated `main` branches).

**Decision tree (what we considered):**
1. **Single actor for filesystem + git compute**
   Keeps fewer types, but long-running git compute occupies the same actor that ingests filesystem bursts.
2. **Split producer/projector (chosen)**
   `FilesystemActor` stays focused on ingestion, routing, filtering, and batching; `GitWorkingDirectoryProjector` materializes git state from facts on the bus.
3. **Per-pane watchers**
   Rejected for duplication and churn. Watchers are app-wide per worktree, projections are pane-scoped.

**Why the split is the stable shape:**
1. Preserves one app-wide ingestion path and one watcher set.
2. Keeps filesystem batching logic in one place (`FilesystemActor`).
3. Makes git state a derived projection that can coalesce by `worktreeId` and publish stable materialized snapshots.
4. Keeps remote git/forge concerns out of local working-directory projection.

**Direct command boundary rule:**

```text
event-plane communication -> EventBus facts
command-plane communication -> direct calls through focused capability protocols
```

Example:

```text
AppDelegate
  |
  v
WatchedFolderCommandHandling
  |
  v
FilesystemGitPipeline
  |
  v
FilesystemActor
```

This is deliberate:

```text
- concrete pipeline ownership stays in the composition root
- feature code should not store concrete actor/pipeline types when a smaller capability will do
- do not invent a generic command executor abstraction just because multiple systems accept commands
```

### D8: Execution backend as pane configuration, not pane type (JTBD 7, JTBD 8)

**User problem:** Users want security boundaries between agent contexts (JTBD 7). Later, they want to move sessions between machines (JTBD 8). The execution environment (bare metal, Docker, Gondolin VM, remote host) varies per pane.

**Decision:** `ExecutionBackend` is a per-pane configuration on `PaneMetadata`, not a pane type. A terminal pane can run on bare metal, Docker, or a Gondolin VM — same `TerminalRuntime`, different backend. Security events flow on the same event stream as all other events, scoped to worktreeId.

**Why not a separate pane type:** The sandbox is the execution environment, not the content. A sandboxed terminal is still a terminal. A sandboxed browser is still a browser. The runtime contract doesn't change — what changes is where the process runs.

**Why security events are cross-cutting:** A sandbox may back multiple panes in the same worktree. Security events (policy violations, secret access, network blocks) are scoped to worktreeId, not paneId. The coordinator fans out to affected panes.

**Deferred but reserved:** The `ExecutionBackend` type and `SecurityEvent` enum are defined now. Implementation ships when Gondolin or Docker integration begins. Zero cost to carry the types.

### D9: System-level event sources — three-tier hierarchy

**User problem:** The workspace needs to react to external signals that aren't pane-scoped — filesystem changes across a worktree, PR status changes, container health, MCP tool availability (JTBD 5, JTBD 6).

**Decision:** Three tiers of system-level event sources, distinguished by who defines the event vocabulary:

1. **Built-in sources** — core-owned, core-implemented. Known event schemas and lifecycle, no plugin involvement. Adding one is a core code change.
2. **Typed service sources** — core defines the event protocol and command interface. Plugin provides the backend implementation for a specific provider. Service category is closed (new category = core code change with typed event vocabulary). Provider is open (String — any plugin can register a backend).
3. **Plugin sources** — plugin defines everything at runtime. Schema opaque to Swift. Uses existing plugin escape hatches (`PaneRuntimeEvent.plugin(kind:event:)`, `PaneKindEvent` conformance). Last resort when no typed protocol exists.

**System source inventory:**

| Tier | Service | Scope | Event types | Envelope | Backend model |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Built-in** | FilesystemActor | Per-worktree | `FilesystemEvent` (filesChanged, worktreeRegistered, worktreeUnregistered) | `WorktreeEnvelope` | Core, one watcher per worktree |
| **Built-in** | AppDelegate | App-wide | `TopologyEvent` (.repoDiscovered — boot replay) | `SystemEnvelope` | Core (via bus) |
| **Built-in** | FilesystemActor | App-wide | `TopologyEvent` (.repoDiscovered — watched folder diff, .repoRemoved — watched folder diff, .worktreeRegistered, .worktreeUnregistered) | `SystemEnvelope` | Core (via bus) |
| **Built-in** | GitWorkingDirectoryProjector | Per-worktree | `GitWorkingDirectoryEvent` (snapshotChanged, branchChanged, originChanged, worktreeDiscovered, worktreeRemoved) | `WorktreeEnvelope` | Core projector |
| **Built-in** | Security backend | Per-worktree | `SecurityEvent` (future) | `WorktreeEnvelope` | Core |
| **Built-in** | PaneCoordinator | App-wide | `LifecycleEvent` (tabSwitched, etc.) | `SystemEnvelope` | Core |
| **Service** | ForgeActor | Per-repo | `ForgeEvent` (pullRequestCountsChanged, checksUpdated, refreshFailed) | `WorktreeEnvelope` | Bus-subscriber + self-polling (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) |
| **Service** | Container service | App-wide | `ContainerEvent` (future: containerStarted, healthChanged, logOutput) | `WorktreeEnvelope` | Plugin backends (Docker, Podman, cloud) |
| **Plugin** | _(open)_ | Varies | `any PaneKindEvent` via `.plugin(kind:event:)` | Varies | Plugin-defined |

All system sources produce `RuntimeEnvelope` events (3-tier: `SystemEnvelope`, `WorktreeEnvelope`, `PaneEnvelope`) on the same `EventBus`. Topology events use `SystemEnvelope` because no canonical entity exists at discovery time. Enrichment events use `WorktreeEnvelope` scoped to known repos/worktrees. See [Workspace Data Architecture](workspace_data_architecture.md) for the full pipeline and event namespace spec.

**Service tier pattern:** A protocol defines the event vocabulary and command interface. Plugin-provided backends conform to the protocol for specific providers. The service manages authentication, polling/webhook state, and event production. This is analogous to how `GhosttyAdapter` translates C API events — the forge adapter translates GitHub API events. Each service source carries `provider: String` identity because multiple backends of the same category can be active simultaneously (GitHub for repo A, GitLab for repo B). `ServiceSource` is a discriminated union — each case will grow service-specific associated values as the service matures (e.g., forge gains `account`, container gains `socket`).

**Plugin tier (deferred):** MCP servers, arbitrary APIs, and other open-ended integrations don't have known event schemas at compile time. They use the existing plugin escape hatches: `PaneRuntimeEvent.plugin(kind:event:)`, `PaneContentType.plugin(String)`, `PaneCapability.plugin(String)`. The plugin infrastructure (Contract 2 escape hatches, NotificationReducer.submit(), EventReplayBuffer) already handles plugin events without core code changes. No new protocol needed — plugins define their own event types conforming to `PaneKindEvent`.


#### FSEvents Watcher Implementation (Contract 6, LUNA-349)

The filesystem watcher is the first system-level source to implement. It's a prerequisite for Contract 16 (pane filesystem context stream, LUNA-344) and the enrichment pipeline (LUNA-350).

```

- One watcher per worktree. Multiple panes sharing a worktree share one watcher.
- Uses `AsyncStream` continuation for event delivery — same pattern as pane runtimes.
- Independent `seq` counter per watcher instance (Invariant A4).
- `FileChangeset.worktreeId` is a denormalized copy of `envelope.sourceFacets.worktreeId` for convenience — envelope source + facets are authoritative (Contract 3, Invariant A1).
- Debounce uses injectable `Clock<Duration>` for testability (Swift 6 Invariant #5).

#### Git Forge Service Pattern (LUNA-350)

> **Authoritative spec:** [Workspace Data Architecture](workspace_data_architecture.md) defines the full ForgeActor design including event-driven triggers, polling fallback, and enrichment flow.

ForgeActor is NOT an independent poller. It subscribes to the EventBus for `.branchChanged` and `.originChanged` events from `GitWorkingDirectoryProjector`, triggering targeted forge API queries. A self-driven polling timer (30-60s) serves as fallback for events that don't originate from local git changes (e.g., CI checks completing remotely).

**ForgeActor triggers:**
- `.branchChanged` → immediate PR status refresh for the affected branch
- `.originChanged` → scope update + full refresh
- Self-driven polling timer (30-60s) → fallback for remote-only events
- Command-plane: `forgeActor.refresh(repo:)` after explicit git push

**ForgeActor does NOT:**
- Scan the filesystem
- Discover worktrees
- Read git config directly (receives enrichment via bus events)

```swift
// Conceptual — protocol shape for typed system services
@MainActor
protocol GitForgeBackend: AnyObject {
    var forgeType: String { get }  // "github", "gitlab", "bitbucket"

    /// Authenticate and begin event polling/webhook listening.
    func connect(config: ForgeConfig) async throws

    /// Subscribe to forge events.
    func subscribe() -> AsyncStream<ForgeEvent>

    /// Execute a forge command (create PR, approve review, etc.)
    func execute(_ command: ForgeCommand) async -> ActionResult

    func disconnect() async
}

// Plugin registration
extension PluginRegistry {
    func registerForgeBackend(_ backend: GitForgeBackend, for type: String)
}
```

The forge service manages authentication, event polling, and command dispatch. Plugin-provided backends conform to the protocol for specific providers. Events are emitted as `PaneRuntimeEvent` envelopes with `source = .system(.service(.gitForge(provider: "github")))` and carried on the same coordination stream. No new infrastructure — just a new source producing envelopes.

**External control interface (deferred):** An API for external systems (CLI, MCP servers, other apps) to control Agent Studio is a future concern. It depends on having runtime command dispatch (Contract 10) working across all 4 runtime types. The command surface would be "which RuntimeCommands can external callers issue, and through what transport?" — this emerges from the internal architecture, not the other way around. A one-paragraph placeholder is sufficient until the internal system is complete.

### Runtime Type Taxonomy

Runtime classes are organized by **transport mechanism** — the underlying technology that connects the Swift runtime to its content backend. This is different from `PaneContentType`, which classifies what the user sees. Multiple content types can share one runtime class.

| Runtime Class | Transport | Content Types Served | Adapter | Controller |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| `TerminalRuntime` | Ghostty C API (PTY + renderer) | `.terminal` | `GhosttyAdapter` (shared singleton) | `SurfaceManager` (shared) |
| `BridgeRuntime` | WKWebView + JSON-RPC bridge | `.diff`, `.editor`, `.review`, `.agent`, `.plugin(...)` | `RPCRouter` (per-pane, inside controller) | `BridgePaneController` (per-pane) |
| `WebviewRuntime` | WKWebView (plain navigation) | `.browser` | WebKit navigation delegate | `WebviewPaneController` (per-pane) |
| `SwiftPaneRuntime` | Native AppKit/SwiftUI (direct calls) | `.codeViewer`, future native panes | None — direct Swift | None — direct Swift |

**Content type → runtime resolution:** When a pane is created, `PaneContentType` determines which runtime class to instantiate. This mapping is static and exhaustive:

```swift
// Conceptual — resolution happens in PaneCoordinator at pane creation time
func runtimeClass(for contentType: PaneContentType) -> PaneRuntime.Type {
    switch contentType {
    case .terminal:                return TerminalRuntime.self
    case .diff, .editor, .review, .agent:
        return BridgeRuntime.self  // React apps via bridge
    case .browser:                 return WebviewRuntime.self
    case .codeViewer:
        return SwiftPaneRuntime.self
    case .plugin(let kind):        return BridgeRuntime.self  // plugins use bridge by default
    }
}
```

**BridgeRuntime dispatches by content type internally.** When BridgeRuntime receives a command or produces an event, it uses `metadata.contentType` to determine content-specific behavior (which React route to load, which RPC methods to register, which event types to emit). The runtime lifecycle, event stream, and command dispatch are identical across content types — only the content semantics differ.

#### TerminalRuntime (implemented)

The reference implementation. Fully conforms to `PaneRuntime`. One instance per terminal pane, registered in `RuntimeRegistry` on pane creation, unregistered on pane close.

- **Adapter:** `GhosttyAdapter` (shared singleton). Routes C callbacks by `surfaceId` → `TerminalRuntime` instance via `RuntimeRegistry` lookup. C FFI boundary uses `@Sendable` trampolines + `Task { @MainActor in }` for safe actor hop.
- **Controller:** `SurfaceManager` (shared). Owns Ghostty surface lifecycle (create, attach, detach, destroy, health, undo). Terminal panes don't have a per-pane controller — the surface manager handles resource management for all terminals.
- **Event production:** `GhosttyAdapter.route()` translates C action tags to `GhosttyEvent` cases, then `TerminalRuntime.handleGhosttyEvent()` wraps in `PaneEventEnvelope` with seq/source/timestamp and yields to the AsyncStream continuation.
- **Command handling:** `TerminalRuntime.handleCommand()` validates lifecycle + capability, then dispatches `.sendInput`, `.resize`, `.search` to the Ghostty surface via `SurfaceManager`.
- **@Observable state:** `title`, `cwd`, `searchState`, `scrollbarState` — bound directly by SwiftUI views.

#### BridgeRuntime (to be extracted from BridgePaneController)

Serves ALL React-based pane types. The content-specific behavior lives in the React app (loaded via `agentstudio://` custom scheme), not in the Swift runtime. The runtime handles lifecycle, event transport, and command dispatch generically.

- **Adapter:** `RPCRouter` (per-pane, owned by `BridgePaneController`). Routes incoming JSON-RPC messages to registered method handlers. Outgoing events are pushed via `PushTransport` to the React app.
- **Controller:** `BridgePaneController` (per-pane). Owns the `WebPage` instance, RPC router configuration, push plan pipeline, bridge handshake state, and dedup cache. The controller handles the WebKit lifecycle — loading the React app, managing `bridge.ready` handshake, and push plan activation.
- **Extraction strategy:** `BridgeRuntime` will be extracted as a new class that:
  1. Conforms to `PaneRuntime` (lifecycle, subscribe, handleCommand, snapshot, eventsSince, shutdown)
  2. Holds a reference to its `BridgePaneController` for transport operations
  3. Produces `PaneEventEnvelope` from incoming RPC events (bridge → Swift direction)
  4. Translates `RuntimeCommand` to outgoing RPC calls (Swift → bridge direction)
  5. Manages its own lifecycle state machine independently of the controller's WebKit state
- **Event production:** Bridge events arrive as JSON-RPC messages from the React app. The RPC router dispatches them. `BridgeRuntime` wraps them as `PaneRuntimeEvent.diff(...)`, `.editor(...)`, or `.browser(...)` in envelopes with proper seq/source.
- **Content type dispatch:** `BridgeRuntime` uses `metadata.contentType` to determine:
  - Which React route to load (e.g., `/diff`, `/editor`, `/review`)
  - Which RPC methods to register on the router
  - Which `PaneRuntimeEvent` case to use for outgoing events
  - Which `PaneCapability` set to expose

#### WebviewRuntime (to be extracted from WebviewPaneController)

Serves plain browser panes. Simpler than BridgeRuntime — no JSON-RPC bridge, no push plans, no React app. Just WebKit navigation events.

- **Adapter:** WebKit navigation delegate (per-pane, owned by `WebviewPaneController`). Translates `WKNavigationDelegate` callbacks to typed `BrowserEvent` cases.
- **Controller:** `WebviewPaneController` (per-pane). Owns the `WebPage` instance, navigation state (URL, title, loading, back/forward lists), and navigation methods (`goBack`, `goForward`, `reload`, `navigate`).
- **Extraction strategy:** `WebviewRuntime` will be extracted as a new class that:
  1. Conforms to `PaneRuntime`
  2. Holds a reference to `WebviewPaneController` for navigation operations
  3. Produces `PaneEventEnvelope` from WebKit navigation delegate events
  4. Translates `.navigation` commands to controller navigation methods
- **Event production:** `BrowserEvent.navigationCompleted`, `.pageLoaded`, `.consoleMessage` wrapped in `PaneRuntimeEvent.browser(...)` envelopes.
- **@Observable state:** `url`, `title`, `isLoading`, `canGoBack`, `canGoForward` — bound directly by `WebviewNavigationBar`.

#### SwiftPaneRuntime (future — new class)

Serves native AppKit/SwiftUI panes that have no WebView. The simplest runtime — no adapter, no controller, direct Swift calls.

- **Adapter:** None. Swift panes produce events directly — no FFI boundary, no message translation.
- **Controller:** None. The view IS the content — no separate resource to manage.
- **Event production:** Direct `continuation.yield()` calls from the Swift view layer. No translation step.
- **Use cases:** `.codeViewer` panes showing syntax-highlighted file content, future native editor panes, settings/configuration panels that need runtime lifecycle tracking.
- **Implementation:** Minimal — lifecycle state machine + event stream + command dispatch. Most of the implementation is the `PaneRuntime` protocol surface itself. Content-specific behavior lives in the SwiftUI views.

### View / Controller / Runtime Separation (per pane type)

Each pane type follows a layered pattern. The layers have distinct responsibilities and change for different reasons:

```

**Why separate controller and runtime:** The controller owns the backend resource (WebKit page, RPC wiring, push plans). The runtime owns the PaneRuntime protocol surface (lifecycle state machine, event stream, command dispatch). This separation means:
- The runtime is testable without a real WebKit instance (inject a mock controller)
- The controller can be reused across content types (one `BridgePaneController` serves diff, editor, review, agent)
- Each layer changes for its own reason: controller changes when transport changes, runtime changes when the PaneRuntime contract changes

### Contract Data Flow Direction

Quick reference: which direction each contract's data flows and which actor boundaries are involved. For the full EventBus coordination design, see [Pane Runtime EventBus Design](pane_runtime_eventbus_design.md).

| Contract | Name | Direction | Actor Boundary | Role |
|----------|------|-----------|----------------|------|
| C1 | PaneRuntime | Bidirectional | @MainActor | Commands in, events out |
| C2 | PaneKindEvent | Outbound | @MainActor → EventBus | Self-classifying events |
| C3 | PaneEventEnvelope | Outbound | Any → EventBus → @MainActor | Bus payload |
| C4 | ActionPolicy | Read-only | @MainActor | Priority classification |
| C5 | Lifecycle | Internal | @MainActor | Forward-only state machine |
| C5a | Attach Readiness | Internal | @MainActor | Readiness gates |
| C5b | Restart Reconcile | Internal | @MainActor | Launch reconcile |
| C6 | Filesystem Batching | Outbound | FilesystemActor → EventBus | Boundary actor source |
| C7 | GhosttyEvent FFI | Inbound→Outbound | C thread → @MainActor → EventBus | Translate, multiplex |
| C7a | Action Coverage | Policy | @MainActor | Exhaustive handling |
| C8 | Per-Kind Events | Outbound | @MainActor → EventBus | Per-kind event flow |
| C9 | Execution Backend | Config | @MainActor | Immutable config |
| C10 | Command Dispatch | Inbound | @MainActor → Runtime | Opposite direction from events |
| C11 | Registry | Lookup | @MainActor | PaneId → Runtime map |
| C12 | NotificationReducer | Consumer | EventBus → @MainActor | Bus subscriber |
| C12a | Visibility Tiers | Policy | @MainActor | Scheduling priority |
| C13 | Workflow Engine | Consumer (deferred) | EventBus → @MainActor | Future bus subscriber |
| C14 | Replay Buffer | Internal | @MainActor | Per-runtime replay |
| C15 | Process Channel | Source (deferred) | Future boundary | Request/response, not bus |
| C16 | Filesystem Context | Projection (deferred) | @MainActor | Derived from C6 |

## Locked Contracts

### Contract Vocabulary

Every contract has a **role** keyword that describes its relationship to the event system:

| Role | Produces events? | Derives from upstream? | Exposes subscription? | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Source** | Yes (original) | No — produces from external signals (OS, C API, agent hooks) | Yes | Contract 6 (worktree watcher), Contract 7 (GhosttyAdapter), Contract 15 (agent RPC) |
| **Projection** | Yes (derived) | Yes — filters/transforms a source's output | Yes | Contract 16 (per-pane CWD filter of Contract 6) |
| **Sink** | No | N/A | No — terminal consumer | Contract 12 (NotificationReducer), Contract 14 (Replay Buffer) |

A projection is a source that depends on another source. It cannot exist without its upstream. "Projection of [source]" names the dependency.

Contracts without a role keyword are **structural** — they define types, protocols, or policies rather than event flow participants (e.g., Contract 1 defines the runtime protocol, Contract 4 defines the priority classification).

#### Source Inventory

Sources are categorized by scope. Topology sources use `SystemEnvelope`; worktree-scoped sources use `WorktreeEnvelope`; pane-scoped sources use `PaneEnvelope`.

| Scope | Source | Tier | Envelope | Events produced | Status |
|-------|--------|------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Pane** | TerminalRuntime | — | `PaneEnvelope` | `.terminal(GhosttyEvent)` | ✅ Implemented |
| **Pane** | BridgeRuntime | — | `PaneEnvelope` | `.diff(...)`, `.editor(...)`, `.review(...)`, `.agent(...)`, `.plugin(...)` | Future (LUNA-349) |
| **Pane** | WebviewRuntime | — | `PaneEnvelope` | `.browser(BrowserEvent)` | Future (LUNA-349) |
| **Pane** | SwiftPaneRuntime | — | `PaneEnvelope` | Content-dependent | Future (LUNA-349) |
| **App** | AppDelegate | Built-in | `SystemEnvelope` | `TopologyEvent` (.repoDiscovered — boot replay) | Via bus |
| **App** | FilesystemActor | Built-in | `SystemEnvelope` | `TopologyEvent` (.repoDiscovered — watched-folder diff, .repoRemoved — watched-folder diff, .worktreeRegistered, .worktreeUnregistered) | Via bus |
| **Worktree** | FilesystemActor | Built-in | `WorktreeEnvelope` | `FilesystemEvent` (.filesChanged, .worktreeRegistered, .worktreeUnregistered) | Future (LUNA-349, Contract 6) |
| **Worktree** | GitWorkingDirectoryProjector | Built-in | `WorktreeEnvelope` | `GitWorkingDirectoryEvent` (.snapshotChanged, .branchChanged, .originChanged, .worktreeDiscovered, .worktreeRemoved) | Future (LUNA-349) |
| **App** | PaneCoordinator | Built-in | `SystemEnvelope` | `.lifecycle(.tabSwitched)` | ✅ Implemented |
| **Repo** | ForgeActor | Service | `WorktreeEnvelope` | `ForgeEvent` (.pullRequestCountsChanged, .checksUpdated, .refreshFailed) | Future (LUNA-350) |
| **App** | Container service | Service | `WorktreeEnvelope` | Future: `ContainerEvent` | Future (plugin-based) |
| **Pane** | Agent RPC channel | — | `PaneEnvelope` | Future: Contract 15 events | Deferred (LUNA-344) |

### Contract 1: PaneRuntime Protocol

```swift
/// Every pane transport type (terminal, bridge, webview, swift) conforms to this.
/// Coordinator only knows this protocol — never pane-type-specific types.
///
/// One instance per pane. All instances share @MainActor.
/// Adapters (GhosttyAdapter, RPCRouter, WebKit delegate) route events
/// to the correct runtime instance by surface/view/pane ID.
///
/// Runtime produces envelopes (not raw events) — routing identity
/// (EventSource) and sequencing (seq) are set by the runtime itself.
/// Coordinator consumes envelopes directly; no wrapping step needed.
@MainActor
protocol PaneRuntime: AnyObject {
    var paneId: PaneId { get }
    var metadata: PaneMetadata { get }
    var lifecycle: PaneRuntimeLifecycle { get }
    var capabilities: Set<PaneCapability> { get }

    /// Dispatch a command. Fails if lifecycle != .ready.
    func handleCommand(_ envelope: RuntimeCommandEnvelope) async -> ActionResult

    /// Current state snapshot for late-joining consumers.
    func snapshot() -> PaneRuntimeSnapshot

    /// Bounded replay for catch-up.
    func eventsSince(seq: UInt64) async -> EventReplayBuffer.ReplayResult

    /// Subscribe to live coordination events as envelopes.
    /// Envelope carries source identity, sequencing, and event payload.
    func subscribe() -> AsyncStream<PaneEventEnvelope>

    /// Graceful shutdown. Returns unfinished command IDs.
    func shutdown(timeout: Duration) async -> [UUID]
}

struct PaneId: Hashable, Codable, Sendable {
    let uuid: UUID
}
typealias WorktreeId = UUID
```

> Identity canonical: `PaneId` is the primary identity and backend session names
> are derived identities. See
> [Session Lifecycle — Identity Contract (Canonical)](session_lifecycle.md#identity-contract-canonical).
>
> **Current Code Status (LUNA-343 branch):**
> - `PaneRuntime` now includes replay wiring via `eventsSince(seq:)`.
> - `PaneMetadata` now includes rich identity fields (`contentType`, `executionBackend`, `createdAt`, `repoId`, `worktreeId`, `parentFolder`, `checkoutRef`).
> - `PaneId` is now a first-class value type (`struct`) with UUIDv7-backed generation and strict canonical decoding.
> - Persisted runtime contracts now decode canonical fields only (no legacy schema fallback).

#### Supporting Types

```swift
/// Rich pane identity used for routing, grouping, and projection.
///
/// Fixed identity fields are creation-time contract in greenfield mode.
///
/// DYNAMIC VIEW CONTRACT: Live fields are ALL OPTIONAL because not every
/// pane has a repo, worktree, or agent. Dynamic views (R5) group panes
/// by these facets — a nil value means the pane doesn't participate in
/// that grouping dimension. This is intentional:
///   - A floating terminal has no repoId, no worktreeId → excluded from
///     "group by repo" and "group by worktree" views
///   - A browser pane showing docs has no agentType → excluded from
///     "group by agent" views
///   - A terminal cd'd into /tmp has cwd but no worktreeId → included
///     in "group by CWD" but not "group by worktree"
///
/// Dynamic view projector reads facet fields from `PaneContextFacets`:
/// repoId, worktreeId, cwd, parentFolder, checkoutRef, agentType, tags.
/// Association fields can be nil independently. `tags` is always present as
/// a set (possibly empty).

### Contract 3: Event Envelope

> **Role:** Structural (envelope shape). Carried by all sources, projections, and sinks.

> **File:** `Core/PaneRuntime/Contracts/RuntimeEnvelopeCore.swift`

> **Extensibility:** `SystemSource` uses a three-tier hierarchy: `BuiltinSource` (closed, core-only), `ServiceSource` (discriminated union — new categories need a core code change with typed event protocol, new providers are a String), and `.plugin(String)` (fully open, schema-free). Per-source isolation guarantees (A4: independent `seq`, A10: independent replay buffer) mean new sources at any tier cannot break ordering or replay for existing sources. No shared state to corrupt.

#### RuntimeEnvelope (3-tier discriminated union)

```swift
/// 3-tier discriminated union. PaneEnvelope is the pane-scoped tier.
/// Tier determines scope: system-wide, per-repo/worktree, or per-pane.

    case pane(PaneEnvelope)
}

```

#### PaneContent vs PaneContentType Mapping

`PaneContent` and `PaneContentType` are intentionally separate:

- `PaneContent` is the persistence/model union with associated state payloads.
- `PaneContentType` is the runtime routing discriminator stored in `PaneMetadata`.

Current mapping rules in code:

| `PaneContent` case | `PaneContentType` |
|---|---|
| `.terminal(TerminalState)` | `.terminal` |
| `.webview(WebviewState)` | `.browser` |
| `.bridgePanel(BridgePaneState(panelKind: .diffViewer, ...))` | `.diff` |
| `.codeViewer(CodeViewerState)` | `.codeViewer` |
| `.unsupported(UnsupportedContent(type: t, ...))` | `.plugin(t)` |

Additional routing kinds (`.editor`, `.review`, `.agent`) are reserved for future bridge panel kinds.

#### Envelope Invariants (normative)

> **Envelope model:** `RuntimeEnvelope` is a 3-tier discriminated union (`SystemEnvelope`, `WorktreeEnvelope`, `PaneEnvelope`). Pane-scoped events use `PaneEnvelope`. The invariants below apply to this model. See [Workspace Data Architecture](workspace_data_architecture.md) for the full hierarchy spec.

1. Sequence ownership: each runtime (or system producer) is the sole writer of `seq` for its own `EventSource`.
2. Monotonicity: `seq` is strictly increasing per `EventSource`. Gaps are allowed only due to bounded replay eviction.
3. Envelope/payload compatibility:
- **SystemEnvelope:** Topology events (`.repoDiscovered`, `.repoRemoved`) — no entity correlation (repo doesn't exist in canonical store yet). App lifecycle (`.tabSwitched`, focus, config changes). Workspace-scoped lifecycle events that are not pane-scoped or worktree-scoped.
- **WorktreeEnvelope:** `repoId` is ALWAYS present — every worktree event belongs to a known canonical repo. `worktreeId` is optional (repo-wide forge events have no single worktree). Filesystem, git working directory, forge, and security events.
- **PaneEnvelope:** `paneId` is ALWAYS present. Terminal, browser, diff, editor, plugin events.
- Pane-scoped payloads (`.terminal`, `.browser`, `.diff`, `.editor`, `.plugin`) require `PaneEnvelope`.
- Filesystem payloads require `WorktreeEnvelope` with `repoId` and `worktreeId`.
- Forge payloads require `WorktreeEnvelope` with `repoId` (worktreeId optional — PR counts are per-branch, not per-worktree).
- Security payloads require `WorktreeEnvelope` with `repoId` and `worktreeId` (security events are always scoped to a specific worktree sandbox, never app-wide).
- Lifecycle events: pane lifecycle (`.paneClosed`, attach/detach) → `PaneEnvelope`. Workspace lifecycle (`.tabSwitched`, focus) → `SystemEnvelope`. Worktree lifecycle (`.worktreeDiscovered`, `.worktreeRemoved`) → `WorktreeEnvelope`.
- Typed service events require `WorktreeEnvelope` with provider identity on the event.
- Plugin system events use the appropriate envelope tier based on their scope (pane-scoped → `PaneEnvelope`, worktree-scoped → `WorktreeEnvelope`, app-scoped → `SystemEnvelope`).
4. Invalid envelope/payload combinations are contract violations and must emit a typed runtime error event.
5. `commandId` is optional and only present for command-correlated events.
6. **Two replay layers:** Bus-level replay (bounded buffer per source, 256 events) serves workspace coordination consumers. Pane-level replay (Contract 14) serves UI consumers joining mid-stream. These are complementary, not conflicting.

### Contract 4: ActionPolicy (self-classifying priority)

```swift
/// Determines how each event is processed.
/// Critical events bypass coalescing. Lossy events batch on frame boundary.
///
/// SELF-CLASSIFYING: Each per-kind event enum implements actionPolicy
/// via PaneKindEvent conformance. The NotificationReducer reads
/// envelope.event.actionPolicy — no centralized classify() method.
/// This means plugin events self-classify without core code changes.
enum ActionPolicy: Sendable {
    case critical                             // immediate delivery, never dropped
    case lossy(consolidationKey: String)      // dedup + coalesce within frame window
}

/// Classification rules (implemented by each PaneKindEvent conformer):
///
/// Lifecycle / cross-cutting: always critical
/// Control actions (command finish, bell, notification): always critical
/// Metadata changes (title, CWD, URL): always critical
/// Viewport/telemetry (scroll, cursor, selection): lossy
/// Rendering (color, font): lossy, consolidate adjacent
///
/// NotificationReducer maintains two queues:
///   criticalQueue — emits immediately, wakes main loop
///   lossyQueue    — batches until next frame (16.67ms at 60fps)
///                   deduped by consolidation key
///                   max queue depth 1000, drops oldest on overflow
```

### Contract 5: PaneLifecycleStateMachine

```swift
/// Shared lifecycle contract for all pane types.
/// Every runtime transitions through these states.
enum PaneRuntimeLifecycle: Sendable {
    case created        // runtime initialized, waiting for first attach/ready
    case ready          // accepting commands, producing events
    case draining       // no new commands accepted, in-flight completing
    case terminated     // all resources released, streams closed
}

/// Lifecycle invariants:
///   1. created → ready (only transition forward)
///   2. ready → draining (on close request)
///   3. draining → terminated (after timeout or all commands complete)
///   4. handleCommand() returns .failure(.runtimeNotReady) if lifecycle != .ready
///   5. shutdown(timeout:) is idempotent — safe to call multiple times
///   6. After terminated, no events emitted, no commands accepted
///   7. Unfinished command IDs returned from shutdown() for logging/recovery
```

#### App Shell Lifecycle Boundary

Application/window lifecycle is separate from pane runtime lifecycle. AppKit ingress is owned by `ApplicationLifecycleMonitor`, which mutates two `@Observable` atomic stores with `private(set)` surfaces:

- `AppLifecycleStore` for app-wide active/terminating state
- `WindowLifecycleStore` for key/focused window identity, registration, transient terminal container geometry, and launch-layout-settle state

Those stores are lifecycle ingress state, not runtime coordination state. The old `AppCommand -> AppEventBus -> controller -> PaneActionCommand` chain has been removed; user-triggered workspace work now enters the validated `PaneActionCommand` pipeline directly.

### Contract 5a: Attach Readiness Policy (LUNA-295)

Terminal panes require a readiness gate before zmx attach. This contract defines two normative policies based on pane visibility at attach time. Both policies implement the `sizePending → sizeReady → attaching → attached/failed` sub-states from the LUNA-295 attach lifecycle diagram above.

#### Ghostty Embedding Facts (normative)

These are verified behaviors of the Ghostty C API that the attach policy depends on:

1. **Geometry is independent of visibility.** `ghostty_surface_set_size(cols, rows)` updates terminal geometry even when the surface is occluded. The terminal reflows content at the new size regardless of whether the surface is rendering.
2. **Visibility is a separate occlusion signal.** `ghostty_surface_set_occlusion(true/false)` controls whether the surface renders. An occluded surface still accepts input and processes escape sequences — it just doesn't paint. Occlusion is not a proxy for geometry validity.
3. **Focus is a separate input signal.** `ghostty_surface_set_focus(true/false)` controls keyboard input routing. Focus, visibility, and geometry are three independent axes.
4. **zmx attach at placeholder size causes reflow.** If a surface is attached before stable geometry, the terminal reflows when the real size arrives. This produces visual flicker (content jumps, prompt redraws). For best UX, attach should use known-good geometry.

#### Policy 1: Active-Visible Attach (default for visible panes)

```swift
/// Readiness gate for panes that are visible at attach time.
/// This is the strict policy — requires real geometry from the view system.
///
/// Preconditions (ALL must be true):
///   1. Surface has a containing window (hasWindow == true)
///   2. Content size is non-zero (width > 0 && height > 0)
///   3. Shell process is alive (process has not exited)
///   4. Deferred attach has not already been sent
///
/// Sequence:
///   1. Pane starts shell (zsh -i -l) → surface created
///   2. Surface enters sizePending (DeferredStartupReadiness gate)
///   3. View system delivers stable frame → sizeReady
///   4. Runtime injects zmx attach text + sends Return key event
///   5. Transition to attaching → attached (or failed with retry)
///
/// Anti-flicker guarantee: attach never occurs against placeholder
/// geometry. The surface has real cols/rows from the view layout.
struct ActiveVisibleAttachPolicy: Sendable {
    /// All four conditions must be true simultaneously.
    static func isReady(
        hasWindow: Bool,
        contentSize: CGSize,
        processAlive: Bool,
        attachSent: Bool
    ) -> Bool {
        hasWindow
            && contentSize.width > 0
            && contentSize.height > 0
            && processAlive
            && !attachSent
    }
}
```

#### Policy 2: Background Prewarm Attach (for non-visible restored panes)

```swift
/// Readiness gate for panes that are NOT visible at attach time.
/// Used during session restore for background panes.
///
/// Background attach uses persisted geometry (cols/rows from the
/// previous session) instead of requiring a visible window. This
/// allows zmx attach to proceed immediately without waiting for
/// the view system to deliver a frame.
///
/// Preconditions (ALL must be true):
///   1. Persisted geometry is available (cols > 0 && rows > 0)
///   2. Shell process is alive
///   3. Deferred attach has not already been sent
///   Note: hasWindow is NOT required — that's the whole point.
///
/// Sequence:
///   1. App restore creates surface in background
///   2. ghostty_surface_set_size(persistedCols, persistedRows)
///   3. Surface enters sizeReady immediately (persisted geometry)
///   4. Runtime injects zmx attach (surface is occluded, no render cost)
///   5. On reveal: ghostty_surface_set_size(actualCols, actualRows)
///      + ghostty_surface_set_occlusion(false)
///   6. Terminal reflows to actual size (single reflow, not flicker)
///
/// Reconcile-on-reveal: when the pane becomes visible, the coordinator
/// delivers the actual frame size. If it differs from persisted
/// geometry, the terminal reflows once. This is a single, expected
/// reflow — not the multi-reflow flicker that placeholder attach causes.
///
/// Persisted geometry source: `PersistedSessionState.lastCols` and
/// `PersistedSessionState.lastRows`, saved by `WorkspacePersistor`
/// on debounced persist (every 500ms of workspace changes).
///
/// Fallback: if no persisted geometry exists (first launch, corrupted
/// state, or session created after last persist), fall back to
/// ActiveVisibleAttachPolicy (shell warms in background, attach
/// deferred until the pane becomes visible and passes the full gate).
struct BackgroundPrewarmAttachPolicy: Sendable {
    static func isReady(
        persistedCols: UInt16,
        persistedRows: UInt16,
        processAlive: Bool,
        attachSent: Bool
    ) -> Bool {
        persistedCols > 0
            && persistedRows > 0
            && processAlive
            && !attachSent
    }
}
```

#### Attach Policy Selection (coordinator responsibility)

```swift
/// The coordinator selects the attach policy based on pane visibility
/// at creation/restore time. This is a one-time decision — once a
/// policy is selected, it governs the pane's attach sequence.
///
/// Decision matrix:
///   - Pane created by user action (new tab, new split) → ActiveVisibleAttachPolicy
///     (pane is always visible when user creates it)
///   - Pane restored, currently active/visible → ActiveVisibleAttachPolicy
///     (pane is visible, use real geometry)
///   - Pane restored, background, has persisted geometry → BackgroundPrewarmAttachPolicy
///     (attach immediately with persisted size, reconcile on reveal)
///   - Pane restored, background, NO persisted geometry → ActiveVisibleAttachPolicy
///     (fallback: defer attach until visible)
///
/// After attach succeeds, the policy is consumed. Subsequent size
/// changes are normal resize events, not attach readiness gates.
```

#### Attach Readiness Invariants

1. **Attach is a one-time gate.** Once a pane transitions from `sizePending → sizeReady → attaching → attached`, the readiness policy is consumed. Subsequent size changes are resize events, not re-attach triggers.
2. **Geometry and visibility are independent signals.** `ghostty_surface_set_size` does not require `ghostty_surface_set_occlusion(false)`. A background pane can be sized without being visible.
3. **Persisted geometry is a best-effort optimization.** If persisted cols/rows are wrong, the terminal reflows on reveal. This is a single reflow, acceptable UX. If no persisted geometry exists, the pane falls back to active-visible policy.
4. **Shell starts before attach.** Both policies start the interactive shell (`zsh -i -l`) immediately. The attach command is deferred — the shell is warm and accepting input when attach arrives. This ensures no lost keystrokes during the attach injection sequence.
5. **Attach injection is text + Return key event.** The runtime writes the zmx attach command as text into the PTY, then sends a real Return key event via Ghostty input injection. This is deliberate — it appears in scrollback as a visible command, making the attach auditable.

### Contract 5b: Restart Reconcile Policy (LUNA-324)

On app launch, the restore flow reconciles persisted workspace state against live zmx daemons before creating any Ghostty surfaces. This prevents stale sessions from consuming resources and ensures orphaned zmx processes are cleaned up.

#### Reconcile Sequence

```swift
/// Executed once during AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching,
/// BEFORE surface creation or pane restoration.
///
/// Input:
///   - persisted: Set<SessionId> from WorkspacePersistor (last saved state)
///   - live: Set<SessionId> from `zmx list` with ZMX_DIR environment
///
/// Dependencies (injected on the owning coordinator/service):
///   - zmxBackend: ZmxBackend instance for session discovery
///   - persistor: WorkspacePersistor for retrieving persisted state
///   - clock: any Clock<Duration> for orphan discovery timestamps
///
/// The reconcile produces a classification for every known session.
/// Surface creation and attach proceed only for runnable sessions.
///
/// This is a SYNCHRONOUS operation — no surfaces exist yet, no races.

enum RestoreClassification: Sendable {
    /// Persisted AND live in zmx → safe to restore.
    /// Action: create surface, apply attach readiness policy.
    case runnable

    /// Persisted but NOT live in zmx → session died while app was closed.
    /// Action: show restart placeholder in the pane slot. User can
    /// restart manually or the pane can be auto-removed after confirmation.
    case expired(reason: String)

    /// Live in zmx but NOT persisted → orphan from a previous crash or
    /// incomplete shutdown. Subject to grace TTL before cleanup.
    case orphan(discoveredAt: ContinuousClock.Instant)
}

struct ReconcileResult: Sendable {
    let runnable: [SessionId: PersistedSessionState]
    let expired: [SessionId: String]  // sessionId → reason
    let orphans: [SessionId: ContinuousClock.Instant]  // sessionId → discoveredAt
}

@MainActor
func reconcileOnLaunch(
    persisted: Set<SessionId>,
    zmxDir: URL
) async -> ReconcileResult {
    // 1. Snapshot live sessions (single zmx list call)
    let live = await zmxBackend.listSessions(zmxDir: zmxDir)
    let liveSet = Set(live.map(\.sessionId))

    // 2. Classify persisted sessions
    var runnable: [SessionId: PersistedSessionState] = [:]
    var expired: [SessionId: String] = [:]
    for sessionId in persisted {
        if liveSet.contains(sessionId) {
            runnable[sessionId] = persistor.state(for: sessionId)
        } else {
            expired[sessionId] = "zmx session not found on launch"
        }
    }

    // 3. Classify runtime-only sessions (orphans)
    let orphanIds = liveSet.subtracting(persisted)
    let now = clock.now
    var orphans: [SessionId: ContinuousClock.Instant] = [:]
    for sessionId in orphanIds {
        orphans[sessionId] = now
    }

    return ReconcileResult(
        runnable: runnable,
        expired: expired,
        orphans: orphans
    )
}
```

#### Orphan Cleanup TTL Policy

```swift
/// Orphans are NEVER killed immediately at discovery. A grace period
/// prevents killing sessions that are legitimately running but not yet
/// persisted (e.g., race condition on previous shutdown).
///
/// Rules:
///   1. Grace TTL: 60 seconds from discovery time.
///   2. Re-check liveness before kill: call `zmx list` again at TTL
///      expiration. If the session is gone, no action needed.
///   3. Log: discovery time, kill attempt time, kill outcome.
///   4. One cleanup cycle per app launch. No continuous background reaping.
///
/// The TTL is injectable via Clock<Duration> for testability.

struct OrphanCleanupPolicy: Sendable {
    let graceTTL: Duration  // default: .seconds(60)
    let clock: any Clock<Duration>

    func shouldKill(
        discoveredAt: ContinuousClock.Instant,
        now: ContinuousClock.Instant
    ) -> Bool {
        now - discoveredAt >= graceTTL
    }
}
```

#### Health Monitoring (post-restore)

```swift
/// After reconcile completes and surfaces are created, periodic health
/// monitoring begins for all runnable sessions.
///
/// Rules:
///   1. Health check interval: 30 seconds (injectable).
///   2. Health check method: `zmx list` filtered to known sessions.
///   3. If a previously-runnable session disappears from zmx list:
///      emit PaneRuntimeEvent.lifecycle(.sessionLost(paneId))
///      → coordinator transitions pane to .draining → .terminated
///      → show restart placeholder
///   4. Health monitoring stops when the pane reaches .terminated.
```

#### Restart Reconcile Invariants

1. **Reconcile before surface creation.** No Ghostty surface is created until reconcile classifies all persisted sessions. This prevents creating surfaces for dead sessions.
2. **Single zmx list snapshot.** Reconcile calls `zmx list` exactly once at startup. Individual session health is checked during the health monitoring phase, not during reconcile.
3. **Orphans get a grace period.** Never kill on first discovery. The 60-second TTL protects against race conditions where a session is legitimate but not yet persisted.
4. **Expired sessions show UI.** An expired session is not silently removed — the user sees a restart placeholder in the pane slot. This is important because the user may have unsaved work context associated with that pane's position in the layout.
5. **ZMX_DIR scoping.** All zmx operations during reconcile use the same `ZMX_DIR` as session creation. This ensures reconcile only discovers sessions owned by this Agent Studio instance, not sessions from other installations.

### Contract 6: Filesystem Batching

> **Role:** Source. Produces `FilesystemEvent` on the coordination stream with `source = .system(.builtin(.filesystemWatcher))` and `sourceFacets.worktreeId = <watcher worktree>`. One watcher instance per worktree — shared across all panes in that worktree. Contract 16 is a projection of this source.

```swift
/// Worktree-scoped filesystem observation contract.
///
/// Rules:
///   1. Debounce window: 500ms (wait for burst settle before flush)
///   2. Max latency cap: 2 seconds (force bounded flush during sustained writes)
///   3. Dedupe key: normalized relative path within worktree
///   4. Max batch size: 256 projected paths per `filesChanged` envelope
///   5. Priority order for due flushes:
///      - focused active-pane worktree
///      - active-in-app worktrees
///      - background/sidebar worktrees
///   6. `.git/**` internals are suppressed from projection-facing path payloads
///   7. Root-level `.gitignore` policy is applied before projection payload emission
///   8. If only suppressed paths changed, emit `filesChanged` with empty `paths`
///      and suppression metadata so downstream projectors can still refresh state
///   9. Identity: each changeset carries `worktreeId` + `rootPath` for self-describing payloads

/// Standalone data structure — may be serialized/stored independently.
/// worktreeId denormalized here for self-documenting data. Canonical
/// source identity is envelope.source + envelope.sourceFacets.
/// IDENTITY vs DOMAIN DATA clarification:
///
/// FileChangeset.worktreeId is a DENORMALIZED COPY of envelope.sourceFacets.worktreeId.
/// It exists for convenience — consumers can access worktreeId
/// without unwrapping facets. Routing decisions use envelope.source + facets;
/// this field is a read-through copy, not a separate source of truth.
///
/// Same pattern as ArtifactEvent.diffProduced(worktreeId:) — worktreeId
/// in the payload is DOMAIN DATA ("which worktree this changeset covers"),
/// while envelope source + facets carry ROUTING IDENTITY.
///
/// In practice, FileChangeset.worktreeId == envelope.source.worktreeId

### Contract 7: GhosttyEvent FFI Enum

```

#### Contract 7a: Ghostty Action Coverage Policy (LUNA-325)

Every `ghostty_action_tag_e` case has a defined handling policy. The adapter's switch is exhaustive — the compiler enforces that adding a new Ghostty action forces a handler decision. This table covers all cases in the `GhosttyEvent` enum (Contract 7). During LUNA-325 implementation, the adapter's exhaustive switch against `ghostty_action_tag_e` will verify completeness at compile time — any Ghostty version with new actions produces a compile error until handled.

| GhosttyEvent Case | Handler | Routing | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Workspace-facing (coordinator consumes)** | | | | |
| `titleChanged` | Runtime → Coordinator | Updates `PaneMetadata.title` | critical | Tab title |
| `cwdChanged` | Runtime → Coordinator | Updates `PaneMetadata.cwd`, triggers repo/worktree resolution | critical | Dynamic view recomputation |
| `commandFinished` | Runtime → Coordinator | Workflow trigger, notification badge | critical | Agent completion signal |
| `bellRang` | Runtime → Coordinator | Notification toast/badge | critical | User attention request |
| `desktopNotification` | Runtime → Coordinator | System notification | critical | From OSC 777 / iTerm2 escape |
| `progressReport` | Runtime → Coordinator | Progress bar UI update | critical | From OSC 9;4 |
| `childExited` | Runtime → Coordinator | Lifecycle transition to draining | critical | Shell/process exit |
| `closeSurface` | Runtime → Coordinator | Pane close flow (with undo) | critical | User Cmd+W or process-initiated |
| **Tab/split requests (coordinator routes)** | | | | |
| `newTab` | Coordinator | Creates new tab via PaneActionCommand | critical | Keyboard shortcut passthrough |
| `closeTab` | Coordinator | Closes tab via PaneActionCommand (with undo) | critical | Keyboard shortcut passthrough |
| `gotoTab` | Coordinator | Tab navigation | critical | |
| `moveTab` | Coordinator | Tab reorder | critical | |
| `newSplit` | Coordinator | Creates split via PaneActionCommand | critical | |
| `gotoSplit` | Coordinator | Focus navigation between splits | critical | |
| `resizeSplit` | Coordinator | Split resize | critical | |
| `equalizeSplits` | Coordinator | Reset split ratios | critical | |
| `toggleSplitZoom` | Coordinator | Zoom/unzoom split | critical | |
| **Terminal-internal state (runtime @Observable)** | | | | |
| `scrollbarChanged` | Runtime only | Updates `@Observable scrollbarState` | lossy("scroll") | 60fps UI binding |
| `searchStarted/Ended` | Runtime only | Updates `@Observable searchState` | critical | Mode transition |
| `searchTotal/Selected` | Runtime only | Updates `@Observable searchState` | lossy("search") | Result count |
| `mouseShapeChanged` | Runtime only | Updates cursor shape | lossy("mouse") | NSCursor update |
| `mouseVisibilityChanged` | Runtime only | Shows/hides cursor | lossy("mouse") | |
| `linkHover` | Runtime only | Shows link preview | lossy("mouse") | URL tooltip |
| `rendererHealth` | Runtime only | Updates `@Observable healthState` | critical | GPU/renderer status |
| `cellSize` | Runtime only | Cell metrics for layout | lossy("cell") | |
| `sizeLimits` | Runtime only | Min/max terminal size | critical | One-time on init |
| `initialSize` | Runtime only | First size report | critical | Attach readiness signal |
| `readOnly` | Runtime only | Read-only mode toggle | critical | |
| **Config/system** | | | | |
| `configReload` | Runtime → Coordinator | Re-apply terminal config | critical | Soft/hard reload |
| `configChanged` | Runtime only | Config delta | critical | |
| `colorChanged` | Runtime only | Terminal color change | lossy("color") | Theme update |
| `secureInput` | Runtime only | Secure input mode | critical | Password entry |
| `keySequence` | Runtime only | Key sequence mode | critical | Leader key |
| `keyTable` | Runtime only | Key table action | critical | |
| `openConfig` | Coordinator | Open config file/UI | critical | User action |
| `presentTerminal` | Coordinator | Bring terminal to front | critical | |
| **Application-level** | | | | |
| `toggleFullscreen` | Coordinator → Window | Window mode change | critical | |
| `toggleWindowDecorations` | Coordinator → Window | Chrome toggle | critical | |
| `toggleCommandPalette` | Coordinator → CommandBar | Open/close ⌘P | critical | |
| `toggleVisibility` | Coordinator → Window | Show/hide app | critical | |
| `floatWindow` | Coordinator → Window | Float/unfloat | critical | |
| `quitTimer` | Coordinator → App | Quit countdown | critical | |
| `undo/redo` | Coordinator → Undo Manager | Edit undo/redo | critical | |
| **Fallback** | | | | |
| `unhandled(tag)` | Adapter | Logged at warning level, never silently dropped | — | Compile-time coverage gap detector |

#### Coverage Invariants

1. **Exhaustive switch.** The adapter's `handleAction(_ action: ghostty_action_s)` switch is exhaustive over `ghostty_action_tag_e`. Adding a new Ghostty version with new actions produces a compile error until a case is added.
2. **No silent drops.** Every action either produces a typed `GhosttyEvent` case or maps to `.unhandled(tag)` which is logged. There is no `default:` branch. The current 12/40 coverage gap exists in the legacy code — this contract requires closing it.
3. **Handler is normative.** The "Handler" column in the table above defines where each event terminates. Runtime-only events do not reach the coordinator. Coordinator events do not mutate runtime state directly — they call store methods.
4. **Priority is per-case.** The "Priority" column matches the `actionPolicy` implementation in `GhosttyEvent.actionPolicy`. Changing priority requires updating both the table and the code.

### Contract 8: Per-Kind Event Enums

Each pane kind has its own event enum — exhaustive within that domain, just as `GhosttyEvent` is exhaustive for the Ghostty C API.

```swift
/// Browser/webview events — from WKNavigationDelegate and WKUIDelegate.

/// Code editor events — cursor, diagnostics, file lifecycle.
/// Conforms to PaneKindEvent — self-classifies priority via actionPolicy.
enum EditorEvent: PaneKindEvent {
    // Cursor/selection
    case cursorMoved(line: Int, column: Int)
    case selectionChanged(range: TextRange?)

    case contentReverted(path: String)

    // Diagnostics
    case diagnosticsUpdated(path: String, errors: Int, warnings: Int)
    case diagnosticSelected(path: String, line: Int, severity: DiagnosticSeverity)

    // File lifecycle
    case fileOpened(path: String, language: String?)
    case fileClosed(path: String)
    case languageDetected(path: String, language: String)

### Contract 9: Execution Backend

### Contract 11: Runtime Registry

```swift
/// Central paneId → runtime lookup. Owned by PaneCoordinator.

final class RuntimeRegistry {
    enum RegistrationResult { case inserted, duplicateRejected }

    private var runtimes: [PaneId: any PaneRuntime] = [:]
    private var kindIndex: [PaneContentType: Set<PaneId>] = [:]

    /// Register a new runtime. Called when pane is created.
    /// Duplicate registration is rejected; existing runtime is preserved.
    @discardableResult
    func register(_ runtime: any PaneRuntime) -> RegistrationResult {
        if runtimes[runtime.paneId] != nil { return .duplicateRejected }
        runtimes[runtime.paneId] = runtime
        kindIndex[runtime.metadata.contentType, default: []]
            .insert(runtime.paneId)
        return .inserted
    }

    /// Unregister after shutdown completes. Returns the runtime for cleanup.
    @discardableResult
    func unregister(_ paneId: PaneId) -> (any PaneRuntime)? {

    /// CONTRACT: Coordinator MUST call unregister() when a runtime reaches
    /// .terminated. This means terminated runtimes are never in the map.

        runtimes[paneId]
    }

        return unfinished
    }

    var count: Int { runtimes.count }
}
```

#### Cross-Pane Subscription (future extensibility)

The `RuntimeRegistry` + `PaneRuntime.subscribe()` infrastructure makes cross-pane event subscription cheap to add. A future contract could expose:

```swift
/// Subscribe to events from multiple panes matching a predicate.
/// Built on existing RuntimeRegistry lookup + per-runtime subscribe().
func subscribe(matching: @Sendable (PaneMetadata) -> Bool) -> AsyncStream<RuntimeEnvelope>
```

This enables use cases like "show all events from panes in worktree X" or "aggregate agent completion signals across repos." No existing contracts need to change — the subscription merges existing per-runtime streams. Deferred until dynamic view or multi-agent orchestration features require it.

### Contract 12: NotificationReducer

> **Role:** Sink. Subscribes to `EventBus<RuntimeEnvelope>`, classifies envelopes by self-declared priority, and delivers to consumers via critical/lossy output streams. Terminal consumer — does not produce events back onto the bus.

```swift
/// Routes events through priority-aware processing.
/// Two completely separate paths — critical and lossy never interact.
///
/// Priority is SELF-CLASSIFIED: each event knows its own ActionPolicy
/// via the PaneKindEvent protocol. The reducer reads event.actionPolicy
/// directly — no centralized classify() method. This means plugin events
/// self-classify without any core code changes.
///
/// Event flow (EventBus path — see pane_runtime_eventbus_design.md):
///   Runtimes post envelopes → EventBus.post(envelope) → fan-out
///     → NotificationReducer subscribes via bus.subscribe()
///       → for await envelope in bus stream
///       → reads envelope.event.actionPolicy (self-classifying)
///       → critical path: immediate yield to consumers
///       → lossy path: buffer until next frame, dedup by consolidation key
///     → Coordinator also subscribes from bus independently
///
/// Note: The reducer consumes from the EventBus, not directly from
/// per-runtime subscribe() streams. The bus provides the merge point
/// so the reducer sees events from ALL runtimes through one stream.
///
/// Subscription contract:
///   - EventBus.subscribe() returns an independent stream per caller.
///   - Each subscriber (reducer, coordinator, future consumers) gets
///     its own stream and consumes at its own pace.
///   - Per-runtime subscribe() still exists for replay catch-up and
///     per-pane direct subscription, but is secondary to the bus path.
@MainActor

#### Where Priority Lives (self-classifying events)

Priority is NOT centralized in the NotificationReducer. Each per-kind event enum implements `actionPolicy` via the `PaneKindEvent` protocol:

```swift
// Built-in: GhosttyEvent knows its own priority
enum GhosttyEvent: PaneKindEvent {
    case commandFinished(exitCode: Int, duration: UInt64)
    case scrollbarChanged(ScrollbarState)
    // ...

    var actionPolicy: ActionPolicy {
        switch self {
        case .commandFinished, .bellRang, .titleChanged, .cwdChanged,
             .newTab, .closeTab /* ... all workspace-facing actions */ :
            return .critical
        case .scrollbarChanged:
            return .lossy(consolidationKey: "scroll")
        case .mouseShapeChanged, .mouseVisibilityChanged, .linkHover:
            return .lossy(consolidationKey: "mouse")
        // ... exhaustive — compiler catches unhandled cases
        }
    }
}

// Plugin: LogViewerEvent knows its own priority too
struct LogViewerEvent: PaneKindEvent {
    enum Kind { case lineAppended, filterChanged, sourceRotated }
    let kind: Kind

    var actionPolicy: ActionPolicy {
        switch kind {
        case .lineAppended:  return .lossy(consolidationKey: "logLine")
        case .filterChanged: return .critical
        case .sourceRotated: return .critical
        }
    }
    // ...
}

// PaneRuntimeEvent delegates to the event (no paneId in cases — lives on envelope):
extension PaneRuntimeEvent {
    var actionPolicy: ActionPolicy {
        switch self {
        case .terminal(let e):      return e.actionPolicy
        case .browser(let e):       return e.actionPolicy
        case .diff(let e):          return e.actionPolicy
        case .editor(let e):        return e.actionPolicy
        case .plugin(_, let e):     return e.actionPolicy  // plugins just work
        case .lifecycle, .filesystem, .artifact, .security, .error:
            return .critical
        }
    }
}
```

### Contract 12a: Visibility-Tier Scheduling (LUNA-295)

Visibility-tier scheduling is the **delivery scheduling** axis — orthogonal to event classification (critical/lossy from D6). Classification determines *how* an event is processed (immediate vs batched). Visibility tiers determine *which pane's events are processed first* when multiple events arrive in the same processing window.

#### Tier Definitions

```swift
/// Visibility tier determines delivery priority within the critical queue.
/// When multiple critical events arrive in the same processing cycle,
/// the coordinator processes them in tier order (p0 first, p3 last).
///
/// Tier assignment is based on pane visibility state at the time the
/// event is submitted to the NotificationReducer, NOT at event creation.
/// This means a pane that becomes visible between event creation and
/// submission gets the correct (higher) tier.
enum VisibilityTier: Int, Comparable, Sendable {
    case p0ActivePane = 0       // active pane in active tab → immediate
    case p1ActiveDrawer = 1     // active pane's drawer panes → next
    case p2VisibleActiveTab = 2 // other visible panes in active tab → after p1
    case p3Background = 3       // hidden/background panes → bounded concurrency

    static func < (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool {
        lhs.rawValue < rhs.rawValue
    }
}
```

#### Tier Resolution

```swift
/// Tier assignment is a coordinator responsibility. The coordinator
/// knows the active tab, the active pane within that tab, and which
/// panes are in the active pane's drawer.
///
/// The reducer calls back to a tier resolver — it does not read
/// workspace state directly. This keeps the reducer testable without
/// a full workspace stack.
///
/// Contract:
///   1. Resolver MUST return a valid tier for any paneId. Unknown
///      paneIds default to .p3Background (safe: delayed, never lost).
///   2. Resolver reads workspace state at call time — tier can change
///      between events for the same pane (e.g., user switches tabs).
///   3. The resolver is injected into the NotificationReducer at
///      construction time.
protocol VisibilityTierResolver: Sendable {
    @MainActor func tier(for paneId: PaneId) -> VisibilityTier
}
```

#### Scheduling Behavior

| Tier | Critical Events | Lossy Events |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| `p0ActivePane` | Immediate delivery, processed first | Batched at frame rate, flushed first |
| `p1ActiveDrawer` | Immediate delivery, processed after p0 | Batched at frame rate, flushed after p0 |
| `p2VisibleActiveTab` | Immediate delivery, processed after p1 | Batched at frame rate, flushed after p1 |
| `p3Background` | Immediate delivery, processed after p2 | Batched at frame rate, flushed last. Bounded concurrency: max N background panes processed per frame cycle |

#### Integration with NotificationReducer

```swift
/// Extended submit() with visibility tier.
/// Tier is resolved at submission time from the pane's current
/// visibility state, not at event creation time.
///
/// Within each tier, ordering follows existing rules:
///   - Critical: per-source seq order (A4)
///   - Lossy: per-source seq within batch, cross-source by timestamp (A6)
///
/// This is ADDITIVE — the NotificationReducer gains a tierResolver
/// parameter and sorts output by tier. No existing contracts change.
func submit(_ envelope: PaneEventEnvelope) {
    let paneId = envelope.source.paneId  // nil for system events → p0
    let tier = paneId.map { tierResolver.tier(for: $0) } ?? .p0ActivePane

    switch envelope.event.actionPolicy {
    case .critical:
        criticalQueue.insert(envelope, at: tier)
        // yield in tier order on next processing cycle

    case .lossy(let consolidationKey):
        let key = "\(tier.rawValue):\(envelope.source):\(consolidationKey)"
        lossyBuffer[key] = (envelope, tier)
        ensureFrameTimer()
    }
}
```

#### Visibility-Tier Invariants

1. **Tier assignment is ephemeral.** Tiers are not stored on the envelope. They are resolved at submission time and used for ordering within the reducer's internal queues. A pane's tier can change between events (user switches tabs).
2. **System events are always p0.** Events with `source = .system(...)` (any tier: builtin, service, or plugin) have no paneId and default to `p0ActivePane`. System events are never deprioritized.
3. **Tier ordering does not affect classification.** A p3 critical event is still processed immediately — it just goes after p0/p1/p2 critical events in the same cycle. Classification (critical/lossy) and scheduling (visibility tier) are independent axes.
4. **Background bounded concurrency.** `p3Background` lossy events are rate-limited: at most N panes' worth of lossy events are flushed per frame cycle (N configurable, default 3). This prevents 20 background terminals from dominating frame budget.
5. **Unknown paneId defaults to p3.** If the resolver cannot find a paneId (pane closing, race condition), it returns `.p3Background`. Events are delayed, never dropped.

### Contract 13: Workflow Engine (deferred)

> Deferred workflow planning now lives in
> [Pane Runtime Ticket Mapping (Minimal)](../plans/2026-02-21-pane-runtime-luna-295-luna-325-mapping.md#deferred-workflow-engine).
>
> Tracks temporal workflows spanning multiple panes and events ("agent finishes → create diff → user approves → signal next agent"). Owned by PaneCoordinator. Implementation deferred until multi-agent orchestration (JTBD 6) moves to automated cross-agent handoffs.
>
> Key types: `WorkflowTracker`, `WorkflowStep`, `StepPredicate`, `WorkflowAdvance`. Integration points: `PaneEventEnvelope.correlationId`, `PaneKindEvent.eventName` for step matching, `EventReplayBuffer` for restart recovery.

### Contract 14: Replay Buffer

> **Role:** Sink. Consumes `PaneEventEnvelope` from the coordination stream and stores them in a bounded ring buffer for late-joining consumers. Terminal consumer — does not produce events back onto the stream.
>
> **Current Code Status (LUNA-342 branch):**
> - `EventReplayBuffer` now includes `Config` (`maxEvents`, `maxBytes`, `ttl`), `ReplayResult`, stale eviction, and gap detection.
> - `PaneRuntime.eventsSince(seq:)` is wired and used by runtime implementations.

```swift
/// Bounded event ring buffer per EventSource for late-joining consumers.
/// Used when: dynamic view opens (needs current state of all panes),
/// drawer expands (needs parent pane context), tab switches (catch up
/// on background events).

### Contract 15: Terminal Process Request/Response Channel (deferred)

> **Role:** Source. Produces `TerminalProcessEvent` on the coordination stream with `source = .pane(id)`. Milestone events only — actual request/response payloads travel on dedicated envelopes, not the coordination stream.

> **Extensibility:** This contract is the ingress point for agent-originated structured commands. Agent-specific protocols (Claude Code hooks, Codex CLI hooks, aider callbacks) are translated into typed `TerminalProcessRequestEnvelope` by **plugin adapters** — one adapter per agent protocol. Core Agent Studio never imports agent-specific formats. The plugin does the translation; this contract provides the typed pipe. Adding a new agent protocol means writing a new plugin adapter, not changing core contracts. See the Agent Harness Communication Model below for the adapter architecture.

> **Status:** Design intent only. Implementation deferred until agent coordination features (JTBD 3, JTBD 6) move beyond basic terminal usage.

This is NOT PTY/raw output. It is a typed request/response channel for agent↔harness coordination — structured commands sent by agents (via MCP or CLI) to Agent Studio, with structured responses back.

```swift
/// Coordination stream carries process milestones only.
/// Adds one case to PaneRuntimeEvent:
///   case terminalProcess(TerminalProcessEvent)
///
/// The coordination stream is NOT for bulk payload transport.
/// It carries: "request accepted," "response completed," "request failed,"
/// "process state changed." Actual data payloads travel on the
/// request/response envelopes below.
enum TerminalProcessEvent: PaneKindEvent {
    case requestAccepted(processSessionId: UUID, requestId: UUID,
                         operation: ProcessOperation)
    case responseCompleted(processSessionId: UUID, requestId: UUID,
                           status: ProcessStatus)
    case requestFailed(processSessionId: UUID, requestId: UUID,
                       reason: String)
    case processStateChanged(processSessionId: UUID,
                             state: ProcessLifecycleState)

    var actionPolicy: ActionPolicy { .critical }
    var eventName: EventIdentifier {
        switch self {
        case .requestAccepted:    return .init("process.requestAccepted")
        case .responseCompleted:  return .init("process.responseCompleted")
        case .requestFailed:      return .init("process.requestFailed")
        case .processStateChanged: return .init("process.stateChanged")
        }
    }
}

/// Inbound: agent → Agent Studio. Typed request envelope.
struct TerminalProcessRequestEnvelope: Sendable {
    let paneId: PaneId
    let processSessionId: UUID
    let requestId: UUID               // idempotency key
    let correlationId: UUID?
    let origin: ProcessOrigin         // which agent/tool produced this request
    let operation: ProcessOperation
    let cwd: URL?
    let timestamp: ContinuousClock.Instant
}

/// Identifies the agent or tool that produced a request.
/// String-based, not an enum — new agent protocols are additive.
/// The core never switches on provider values; plugins set them,
/// and the value flows through for logging, UI display, and
/// workflow correlation.
///
/// Convention: "claude-code", "codex", "aider", "cursor-cli",
/// or plugin-defined values like "custom-agent-v2".
struct ProcessOrigin: Hashable, Sendable {
    let provider: String              // agent protocol identifier
    let version: String?              // optional agent version
    init(provider: String, version: String? = nil) {
        self.provider = provider
        self.version = version
    }
}

/// Outbound: Agent Studio → agent. Typed response envelope.
struct TerminalProcessResponseEnvelope: Sendable {
    let paneId: PaneId
    let processSessionId: UUID
    let requestId: UUID               // matches request
    let success: Bool
    let result: ProcessResultPayload
    let timestamp: ContinuousClock.Instant
}
```

#### Contract 15 Invariants

1. **Request/response keyed by `requestId`, idempotent.** Duplicate requestIds return the cached response, not re-execution.
2. **Ordering guarantee is per `processSessionId`.** Within a process session, requests are processed in order. Cross-session ordering is best-effort.
3. **No PTY/raw output on this channel.** This is structured RPC, not terminal I/O.
4. **Core coordination stream carries milestones, not bulk payloads.** Data travels on request/response envelopes; the PaneRuntimeEvent stream gets milestone notifications only.

#### Agent Harness Communication Model (design intent)

The terminal process channel is the foundation for a broader agent harness architecture:

```
Agent (MCP client / CLI)
        │
        ▼
Harness Adapter Layer
(MCP server adapter, CLI adapter)
        │
        ▼
Single Harness Command Bus (typed JSON-RPC)
        │
        ▼
Agent Studio Command Gateway
(authz, scope checks, idempotency)
        │
        ▼
PaneCoordinator / WorkflowTracker / Stores
        │
        ▼
PaneRuntimeEvent stream → Harness Event Gateway → adapters → agent
```

**One core protocol, two adapters:**
- **CLI adapter** — fast, local, scriptable. For direct agent-to-harness communication.
- **MCP adapter** — tool-friendly for LLM agents. Exposes Agent Studio operations as MCP tools.
- Both map to the same internal command/event contracts.

**Plugin-as-adapter model:** Each agent protocol (Claude Code hooks, Codex CLI notifications, aider callbacks) gets a **plugin adapter** that translates agent-specific formats into typed `TerminalProcessRequestEnvelope` with a `ProcessOrigin` identifying the agent. Core Agent Studio is agent-agnostic — it never imports agent-specific hook formats. Plugins do the translation. This means supporting a new agent is a plugin change, not a core change.

**Use cases:** Work tracker with dependencies and sub-projects, agent status queries, cross-agent coordination, project state management. Agents interact with Agent Studio as a structured workspace, not just a terminal host.

### Contract 16: Pane Filesystem Context Stream (deferred)

> **Role:** Projection of Contract 6 (Filesystem Batching). Derives per-pane filesystem events by filtering the worktree watcher's output to the pane's current CWD subtree. Depends on Contract 6 as its upstream source — cannot exist without it.

> **Extensibility:** New per-pane derived streams (e.g., "pane git blame context", "pane dependency graph") follow the same projection pattern: filter an upstream source by pane-scoped criteria, expose a typed subscription. Adding a new projection does not change the upstream source or existing projections.

> **Status:** Design intent only. Implementation deferred until per-pane filesystem awareness features are built.

A derived, per-pane filesystem context stream based on the pane's current CWD. Separate from the terminal process request/response channel.

```swift
/// Per-pane filesystem context — derived from worktree watcher + pane CWD.
///
/// DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
///   1. One watcher per worktree/root (not per pane). Shared infrastructure.
///   2. Per-pane stream is a FILTERED VIEW of the worktree watcher,
///      scoped to the pane's current CWD subtree.
///   3. When pane CWD changes, the filter re-scopes automatically.
///   4. Batched events only (no per-file spam). Uses Contract 6 batching.
///   5. This is SEPARATE from terminal process request/response (Contract 15).
///
/// Relationship to existing contracts:
///   - Contract 6 (Filesystem Batching) provides the raw worktree-level batches
///   - Contract 16 derives per-pane views from those batches
///   - FilesystemEvent on the coordination stream is the worktree-level signal
///   - PaneFilesystemContext is the pane-level derived stream
struct PaneFilesystemContext: Sendable {
    let paneId: PaneId
    let cwd: URL                         // pane's current CWD
    let worktreeId: WorktreeId           // which worktree watcher provides data
}

/// Derived per-pane filesystem events — filtered from worktree watcher.
/// Only includes changes within the pane's CWD subtree.
enum PaneFilesystemContextEvent: PaneKindEvent {
    case cwdSubtreeChanged(paths: Set<String>, batchSeq: UInt64)
    case gitWorkingTreeInCwd(staged: Int, unstaged: Int, untracked: Int)

    var actionPolicy: ActionPolicy { .critical }
    var eventName: EventIdentifier {
        switch self {
        case .cwdSubtreeChanged: return .init("fs.cwdSubtreeChanged")
        case .gitWorkingTreeInCwd: return .init("fs.gitWorkingTreeInCwd")
        }
    }
}
```

#### Contract 16 Invariants

1. **Filesystem context stream is derived, never primary.** Source of truth is the worktree watcher (Contract 6). Per-pane context is a filtered projection.
2. **One watcher per worktree, not per pane.** Multiple panes in the same worktree share the same watcher. Per-pane filtering happens at the stream level.
3. **CWD change re-scopes the filter.** When a pane's CWD changes (from CWD propagation), its filesystem context stream automatically re-filters.
4. **Batched events only.** Inherits Contract 6 batching (500ms debounce, 2s max latency, 256-path chunks). No per-file spam on the per-pane stream.

## Sharp Edges & Mitigations

### 1. Global stream as choke point

**Risk:** One AsyncStream for all events can become a bottleneck with 10+ active terminals.

**Mitigation:** Ordering is per-source (`seq` field on envelope, monotonic within each `EventSource`), not one total global sequence. The EventBus fans out each posted envelope to all subscribers independently — there is no global merge or serialization step. Per-source ordering is the guarantee; cross-source ordering uses `timestamp` for best-effort. This is sufficient for UI rendering and workflow matching but not for strict causal ordering across panes.

### 2. Priority inversion in batching

**Risk:** High-frequency lossy events block critical events in the same coalesce window.

**Mitigation:** Hard rule: critical events bypass the coalescing path entirely. The `NotificationReducer` maintains two separate queues. Critical events emit immediately and wake the main loop. Lossy events batch until next frame. These paths never interact.

### 3. Event storm from filesystem watchers

**Risk:** Agent writes 500 files → FSEvents fires 500+ raw events → local git projection thrashes.

**Mitigation:** Worktree-scoped debounce (500ms settle window) + deduped path set + 256-path chunking + max latency cap (2 seconds). `GitWorkingDirectoryProjector` coalesces by `worktreeId` (latest wins), so one noisy burst converges to bounded recompute work. Multiple worktrees remain independent.

### 4. Replay buffer memory growth

**Risk:** Ring buffer per runtime accumulates unbounded memory if events are large or frequent.

**Mitigation:** Bounded ring buffer per `EventSource` key (`.pane`, `.worktree`, `.system`). Each source gets a 1000-event ring buffer with TTL (5 minutes) and max bytes cap (1MB). Oldest events evicted first. One noisy source doesn't starve replay for others.

### 5. Lifecycle leaks for background panes

**Risk:** Background pane closes but runtime keeps producing events, leaking resources.

**Mitigation:** Explicit lifecycle contract: `created → ready → draining → terminated`. `shutdown(timeout:)` drains in-flight commands (max 5 seconds), closes all event stream continuations, releases C API handles, and returns unfinished command IDs. Coordinator logs any unfinished commands. After `terminated`, the runtime rejects all interactions.

### 6. Idempotency gaps on temporal workflows

**Risk:** Coordinator restarts mid-workflow (crash, suspension). "Agent finished → create diff → wait for approval" loses its place.

**Mitigation:** Every workflow step carries `commandId` (idempotent per-step) and `correlationId` (links the full workflow chain). Coordinator can detect completed steps via commandId on replay.

**Limitation (v1):** Restart-safe replay requires `epoch` to distinguish "caught up in current runtime" from "new runtime, seq reset." Since `epoch` is `0` in v1, `eventsSince(seq:)` after a runtime restart may return events from the new epoch with overlapping seq numbers. **Consumers must use `snapshot()` after runtime restart, not `eventsSince()`.** True restart-safe replay requires activating epoch (see Sharp Edge #7).

### 7. Epoch field deferred but reserved

**Risk:** Adding `epoch` later requires protocol changes and migration.

**Mitigation:** `epoch` field is in the envelope now, set to `0`. Zero cost to carry. When activated, epoch increments on runtime restart/reconnect, enabling stale-view detection and safe seq comparison across restarts.

**v1 constraint:** With `epoch == 0`, `eventsSince(seq:)` is NOT safe across runtime restarts — seq resets but epoch doesn't increment, so the consumer can't detect the reset. **After runtime restart, consumers must call `snapshot()` to re-sync, not `eventsSince()`.** This is documented in Sharp Edge #6 and the Architectural Invariants (A9).

### 8. Execution backend lifecycle mismatch

**Risk:** Sandbox (Gondolin/Docker) starts before the runtime is ready, or crashes while the runtime is still producing events.

**Mitigation:** Execution backend lifecycle is independent of pane runtime lifecycle. The sandbox starts and becomes healthy before the runtime transitions to `ready`. If the sandbox dies, a `SecurityEvent.sandboxHealthChanged(healthy: false)` fires, and the coordinator can either restart the sandbox or transition the runtime to `draining`. The pane's `PaneMetadata.executionBackend` is immutable after creation — to change backends, close the pane and create a new one. Live backend migration is a future capability (no SecurityEvent case exists for it yet).

### 9. Bus becoming a god object

**Risk:** Event bus accumulates routing logic, filtering, batching, domain decisions, workflow branching.

**Mitigation:** The bus is a dumb fan-out pipe: `post()` and `subscribe()` are its only operations. It never filters, batches, transforms, or makes domain decisions. Filtering and batching live in consumers (`NotificationReducer` for priority-aware delivery, coordinator for replay buffering). Domain logic lives in runtimes. Stream operators from `swift-async-algorithms` (merge, filter, throttle) are applied by consumers on their subscription streams, not inside the bus itself. If the bus grows methods beyond `post()` and `subscribe()`, it's doing too much.

## Migration: NotificationCenter/DispatchQueue → AsyncStream/Event Bus

The current codebase uses `NotificationCenter` and `DispatchQueue.main.async` for Ghostty C callback dispatch. This architecture replaces those mechanisms. This section documents the migration path — what changes, what stays, and what order.

### What Gets Replaced

| Current Mechanism | Replacement | Migrated By |
|---|---|---|
| `NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .ghosttyAction, ...)` | `GhosttyAdapter` → typed `GhosttyEvent` → `TerminalRuntime.handleEvent()` | LUNA-325 |
| `DispatchQueue.main.async { ... }` in C callback trampolines | `Task { @MainActor in ... }` or direct `@MainActor` calls | LUNA-342 (partial — wakeup_cb, initialize), LUNA-325 (remaining 23 instances) |
| `@objc` notification observers in `PaneCoordinator` | `for await envelope in bus.subscribe()` in coordinator event loop (EventBus fan-out) | LUNA-325 |
| `userInfo` dictionaries on notifications | Typed `GhosttyEvent` enum cases with associated values | LUNA-325 |
| String-keyed notification names (`.ghosttyTitleChanged`, etc.) | Exhaustive `GhosttyEvent` enum switch (compile-time coverage) | LUNA-325 |

### What Stays (Not Migrated)

| Mechanism | Why It Stays |
|---|---|
| `NSApplication.shared` notifications (`.willTerminate`, etc.) | AppKit lifecycle — not event bus material |
| `NSWorkspace.shared.notificationCenter` (volume mount, screen changes) | System-level notifications — no benefit from typed events |
| Any Combine usage in third-party dependencies | Out of our control |

### Migration Order

1. **LUNA-327 (done):** `@Observable` migration, `private(set)` stores, `PaneCoordinator` consolidation. Foundation for the event bus. `DispatchQueue.main.async` → `MainActor` primitives where touched.
2. **LUNA-342 (done):** Contract freeze + Swift 6 language mode migration. `.swiftLanguageMode(.v6)` enforced, all `isolated deinit` migrations complete, `MainActor.assumeIsolated` removed from Sources, C callback trampolines partially migrated (`wakeup_cb` done), existential Sendable constraints added. SwiftLint concurrency rules added (44 violations marking LUNA-325 scope). See [migration spec](../plans/2026-02-22-swift6-language-mode-migration.md) and [mapping doc](../plans/2026-02-21-pane-runtime-luna-295-luna-325-mapping.md#luna-342-implementation-record) for details.
3. **LUNA-325 (in progress):** `GhosttyAdapter`, `TerminalRuntime`, `RuntimeRegistry`, `NotificationReducer`, and runtime command dispatch scaffolding are landed. Migrated split/tab action families are now routed through typed runtime events (no dual-path NotificationCenter posts for migrated actions). Remaining full-contract parity is tracked through the LUNA-325/LUNA-345 closure gate.
4. **LUNA-295 (attach orchestration):** Build attach readiness policies and visibility-tier scheduling. Consumes the event stream infrastructure from LUNA-325.
5. **LUNA-324 (restart reconcile):** Build startup reconcile classification, orphan TTL cleanup, and post-restore health monitoring (Contract 5b).

### Migration Invariant

**No dual-path period (data-plane actions).** When a pane runtime action is migrated to the event bus, the corresponding `NotificationCenter.post()` call is deleted in the same commit. There is no compatibility shim where both paths fire. This migration remains per-action (one `GhosttyEvent` case at a time), not big-bang.

**Lifecycle ingress now has its own boundary:** App/window lifecycle is no longer modeled as runtime `NotificationCenter.post` exceptions. `ApplicationLifecycleMonitor` owns AppKit ingress and writes `AppLifecycleStore` / `WindowLifecycleStore`, while Ghostty surface close/CWD/renderer-health handling uses typed local/runtime boundaries.

---

## Architectural Invariants

Structural guarantees that hold across all contracts. Each invariant is enforced at a specific layer and has a defined violation response. These are the rules implementation MUST uphold — not aspirational guidelines.

### Identity & Routing

**A1. Routing identity lives on the envelope, never in event payloads.** `EventSource` on `PaneEventEnvelope` is the single source of truth for "who produced this event." Event payloads carry domain data only (e.g., `ArtifactEvent.worktreeId` = "where the artifact belongs," not "who produced it"). If routing identity and domain data happen to match (e.g., `FileChangeset.worktreeId` == `envelope.source.worktreeId`), the envelope is authoritative on any divergence.

*Enforced by:* Code review + contract tests asserting no `paneId`/`worktreeId` routing fields in event enum cases.

**A2. One runtime instance per pane. One adapter instance per backend technology.** `RuntimeRegistry` enforces uniqueness on `register()` by rejecting duplicate pane registrations and preserving the first runtime. Adapters (`GhosttyAdapter` for terminal, `RPCRouter` for bridge, WebKit delegate for webview) route by surface/view/pane ID to the correct runtime instance. `GhosttyAdapter` is a shared singleton; bridge and webview adapters are per-pane (owned by their controllers). No pane ever has two runtimes; no runtime ever serves two panes.

*Enforced by:* `RuntimeRegistry.register()` result (`inserted` vs `duplicateRejected`) with duplicate rejection logging. Violation response = reject replacement and preserve existing runtime mapping.

**A3. RuntimeRegistry is the sole lookup for paneId → runtime.** No parallel maps, no caching of runtime references outside the registry. Coordinator, event bus, and all consumers go through `RuntimeRegistry.runtime(for:)`. Terminated runtimes are removed via `unregister()` — the registry never contains terminated entries.

*Enforced by:* `unregister()` called by coordinator as part of the termination sequence. Violation = leaked runtime (detected by periodic registry audit in debug builds).

### Ordering & Sequencing

**A4. `seq` is monotonic per `EventSource`.** Each runtime (or system producer) is the sole writer of its own sequence counter. `seq` values are strictly increasing within a single `EventSource`. Gaps are allowed only due to replay buffer eviction.

*Enforced by:* Runtime produces envelopes with `seq` from its own counter. No external code writes `seq`.

**A5. Cross-source ordering is best-effort via `timestamp`.** No global sequence number exists. Cross-source ordering uses `ContinuousClock.Instant` timestamps. This is sufficient for UI rendering and workflow matching but NOT for strict causal ordering across panes.

*Enforced by:* Design decision (D2). No global sequence counter to maintain.

**A6. Lossy batch ordering preserves per-source order.** When `NotificationReducer` flushes the lossy buffer, events are sorted by `(source, seq)` within the batch. Cross-source ordering within a batch uses timestamps (best-effort).

*Enforced by:* `flushLossyBuffer()` sorts before yielding. Unit tests verify per-source ordering in batched output.

### Classification & Priority

**A7. Self-classifying priority — single classification authority per event.** Each per-kind event enum implements `actionPolicy` via `PaneKindEvent` conformance. `NotificationReducer` reads `envelope.event.actionPolicy` — no centralized `classify()` method, no priority field cached on the envelope. Plugin events self-classify without core code changes.

*Enforced by:* `PaneKindEvent` protocol requirement. Compile error if `actionPolicy` is missing.

**A8. Critical and lossy paths never interact.** Critical events bypass coalescing entirely (immediate delivery, wake main loop). Lossy events batch on frame boundary (16.67ms). The `NotificationReducer` maintains two separate queues. No priority inversion is possible between these paths. The coordinator's critical consumer Task runs at `.userInitiated` priority; the lossy consumer runs at `.utility`. This ensures the MainActor scheduler resumes critical event processing before lossy batch processing when both have pending work.

*Enforced by:* `submit()` branches on `actionPolicy` at the top level. No shared buffer between paths. Task priority annotations on coordinator event loop consumers.

### Replay & Recovery

**A9. `eventsSince(seq:)` is NOT safe across runtime restarts in v1.** With `epoch == 0`, a runtime restart resets `seq` but epoch doesn't increment. Consumers cannot distinguish "caught up in current runtime" from "new epoch." **After runtime restart, consumers MUST call `snapshot()` to re-sync.** True restart-safe replay requires activating the epoch field (future).

*Enforced by:* Documentation. Implementation will add `precondition(epoch > 0)` guard when epoch is activated.

**A10. Replay buffer is bounded per `EventSource`.** Each source gets its own ring buffer (default: 256 events). One noisy source cannot starve replay for others. Eviction is oldest-first. Gap detection via `ReplayResult.gapDetected` tells the consumer to fall back to `snapshot()`. This is the bus-level replay buffer; pane-level replay (Contract 14) is a separate concern with its own bounds.

*Enforced by:* `EventReplayBuffer.Config` bounds. Buffer constructor validates config.

### Lifecycle

**A11. Lifecycle transitions are forward-only.** `created → ready → draining → terminated`. No backward transitions. No skipping states. `handleCommand()` rejects commands if `lifecycle != .ready`. After `terminated`, no events emitted, no commands accepted, runtime is unregistered from `RuntimeRegistry`.

*Enforced by:* `PaneRuntimeLifecycle` state machine with compile-time transition validation. Violation = `.failure(.runtimeNotReady)`.

**A12. `shutdown(timeout:)` is idempotent.** Safe to call multiple times. First call initiates draining. Subsequent calls are no-ops that return the same unfinished command list.

*Enforced by:* Guard on lifecycle state in `shutdown()` implementation.

### Metadata & Dynamic Views

**A13. PaneMetadata facet associations are optional, identity is not.** `paneId` is required and immutable. Facet associations (`repoId`, `worktreeId`, `parentFolder`, `cwd`, `agentType`, `origin`, `upstream`) can be absent independently. `tags` is always present (possibly empty). Not every pane participates in every dynamic-view grouping dimension; absent facet values intentionally exclude that pane from that grouping.

*Enforced by:* `paneId` is non-optional and v7-validated. Facet fields are optional where association is conditional, and `tags` defaults to an empty array. Dynamic view projector treats missing facet values as "not in this grouping."

**A14. `PaneMetadata.executionBackend` is immutable after creation.** To change backends, close the pane and create a new one. Live migration is a future capability with no current SecurityEvent case.

*Enforced by:* `let executionBackend` (immutable). Compile error on mutation attempt.

### Event Scoping

**A15. Source/payload compatibility is a contract invariant.** Pane-scoped payloads (`.terminal`, `.browser`, `.diff`, `.editor`, `.plugin`) require `source = .pane(id)`. Filesystem payloads require `source = .system(.builtin(.filesystemWatcher))` and `sourceFacets.worktreeId`. Security payloads require `source = .system(.builtin(.securityBackend))`. Workspace lifecycle events not pane-scoped require `source = .system(.builtin(.coordinator))`. Typed service events require `source = .system(.service(...))` with provider identity. Plugin system events require `source = .system(.plugin(kind))`. Invalid combinations are contract violations — runtime emits `RuntimeErrorEvent` rather than silently misrouting.

*Enforced by:* Envelope invariant #3 and #4 (Contract 3). Validated at envelope creation in runtime.

---

## Swift 6 Type and Concurrency Invariants

Hard rules for all types in this architecture. Violations are compile errors, not style preferences.

1. **All cross-boundary payloads are `Sendable`.** Every struct, enum, and protocol in the event/action/envelope pipeline conforms to `Sendable`. No bare `Error` — use `any Error & Sendable` or serialize to typed payloads (see `RuntimeErrorEvent.underlyingDescription`).

2. **No stringly-typed event identity in core contracts.** `EventIdentifier`, `PaneContentType`, and `PaneCapability` are typed enums (with `.plugin(String)` escape hatches) instead of bare strings.

3. **No `DispatchQueue.main.async` / `NotificationCenter` selector patterns.** These are v5-era patterns incompatible with Swift 6 concurrency conventions. C API callbacks use `Task { @MainActor in }` for async work. Event transport uses `AsyncStream` + `swift-async-algorithms`. 23 `DispatchQueue.main.async` and 20 `NotificationCenter` selector instances remain as technical debt — tracked by SwiftLint concurrency rules (`no_dispatch_queue_main`, `no_notification_center_selector`) and migrated by LUNA-325.

4. **Callback handoff is explicitly actor-safe.** Static `@Sendable` trampolines at FFI boundary. No closures capturing mutable state across isolation boundaries. Adapters are `@MainActor` — the trampoline is the only non-isolated code.

5. **Clock/timer behavior is testable and migration-ready.** New time-dependent logic should use injectable clock boundaries; current replay implementation uses `ContinuousClock` with explicit constructor injection and store-level `Task.sleep` migration remains tracked.

6. **Existentials (`any`) are explicit and minimized.** `any PaneRuntime` at registry lookup boundaries and `any PaneKindEvent` at the plugin escape hatch. No implicit existential boxing — every `any` is a conscious decision at a boundary.

7. **`@MainActor` is the isolation domain for all runtime state.** All stores, runtimes, coordinators, and registries are `@MainActor`. Thread safety enforced at compile time. The protocol is `async` to reduce (not eliminate) actor-per-pane migration cost (D1). Sync protocol members would need conversion; see D1 for honest cost assessment.

8. **Envelope validity is enforced.** `source` + `event` compatibility and monotonic `seq` per `EventSource` are contract-level invariants, not best-effort behavior.

9. **macOS 26 primitives are mandatory for new plumbing.** Use Observation (`@Observable`) for UI-facing state, `AsyncStream` + `swift-async-algorithms` for transport, `Clock<Duration>` for timing, and `Task { @MainActor in }` for actor-safe callback handoff at C boundaries. See [Swift 6 Concurrency](appkit_swiftui_architecture.md#swift-6-concurrency) for full rules and common false positives.

## Tradeoff Summary

### Compared to coordinator-only routing (status quo)

You **gain** cleaner separation (adapter/runtime/coordinator layers), long-term maintainability (new pane types don't bloat the coordinator), typed event capture (no silent drops), and testability (mock adapters, test runtimes in isolation).

You **pay** more upfront contracts and stricter schemas. Every new event kind must be added to the enum and classified. Every new pane type must implement the protocol.

### Compared to actor-per-pane now

You **avoid** major complexity (actor async boundaries on every property access, mailbox lifecycle management, ordering challenges) and migration cost.

You **accept** the risk that `@MainActor` becomes a bottleneck for high-frequency terminals. Mitigation: protocol is `async` from day one, which minimizes (but does not eliminate) caller-side migration cost. Sync protocol members (`paneId`, `metadata`, `snapshot()`) would need conversion to `async` or `nonisolated`. Profile before deciding.

### Compared to three separate planes

You **reduce** ordering hazards (single stream, per-source ordering with cross-source best-effort) and operational complexity (one stream to debug, not three).

You **accept** the discipline of classifying every event kind (critical vs lossy) and maintaining the priority table. The event enum makes this explicit — you can't add an event without deciding its priority.

## Directory Placement

Contract types are shared pane-system domain infrastructure — used by all features, not owned by any single feature. They live in `Core/PaneRuntime/`. Feature-specific implementations (adapters, concrete runtimes) live in each `Features/X/` directory. The coordinator stays in `App/` as the composition root.

See [Directory Structure](directory_structure.md) for the full decision process and import rules.

| Type | Directory | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Contracts** (PaneRuntime protocol, PaneRuntimeEvent, PaneEventEnvelope, RuntimeCommand, RuntimeCommandEnvelope, PaneLifecycle, PaneMetadata, ActionPolicy, PaneCapability, per-kind event/command enums) | `Core/PaneRuntime/Contracts/` | Imported by all features and App; change driver is pane system contract, not any specific feature |
| **RuntimeRegistry** | `Core/PaneRuntime/Registry/` | Feature-agnostic lookup; consumed by PaneCoordinator in App/ |
| **NotificationReducer**, VisibilityTier types | `Core/PaneRuntime/Reduction/` | Feature-agnostic event processing; consumed by PaneCoordinator |
| **EventReplayBuffer** | `Core/PaneRuntime/Replay/` | Feature-agnostic buffering; consumed by PaneCoordinator |
| **GhosttyAdapter** | `Features/Terminal/Ghostty/` | FFI-specific; translates C callbacks into Core event types |
| **TerminalRuntime** | `Features/Terminal/Runtime/` | Terminal-specific `PaneRuntime` conformance |
| **BridgeRuntime** (future) | `Features/Bridge/Runtime/` | Bridge-specific `PaneRuntime` conformance (serves .diff, .editor, .review, .agent, .plugin) |
| **BridgePaneController** | `Features/Bridge/Runtime/` | Per-pane WebKit page, RPC router, push plans (transport/view-side lifecycle) |
| **WebviewRuntime** (future) | `Features/Webview/Runtime/` | Webview-specific `PaneRuntime` conformance (serves .browser) |
| **WebviewPaneController** | `Features/Webview/` | Per-pane WebKit page, navigation state (transport/view-side lifecycle) |
| **SwiftPaneRuntime** (future) | `Features/SwiftPane/Runtime/` | Native AppKit/SwiftUI `PaneRuntime` conformance (serves .codeViewer) |
| **FSEventsWatcher** (future) | `Core/PaneRuntime/Sources/` | System-level filesystem watcher; produces FilesystemEvent envelopes |
| **PaneCoordinator** | `App/` | Imports from multiple features; composition root |

### Why per-kind event enums live in Core

`GhosttyEvent`, `BrowserEvent`, `DiffEvent`, `EditorEvent` are cases in the `PaneRuntimeEvent` discriminated union (Contract 2). Since `PaneRuntimeEvent` is in `Core/PaneRuntime/Contracts/` and Core cannot import Features, all per-kind event enums must also be in Core. These enums define the **domain event vocabulary** — what the system says about terminal/browser/diff/editor events. The adapters that *produce* these events from platform APIs live in Features.

### Naming: RuntimeCommand vs PaneActionCommand

Two distinct action layers exist with different scopes:

| Layer | Type | Location | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| **Workspace** | `PaneActionCommand` | `Core/Actions/` | Workspace structure mutations — selectTab, closePane, insertPane, toggleDrawer |
| **Runtime** | `RuntimeCommand` | `Core/PaneRuntime/Contracts/` | Commands to individual runtimes — sendInput, navigate, approveHunk |

`PaneActionCommand` flows: User → ActionResolver → ActionValidator → PaneCoordinator → WorkspaceStore.
`RuntimeCommand` flows: PaneCoordinator → RuntimeRegistry → `runtime.handleCommand(envelope)`.

`AppEventBus` is reserved for app-level notifications that are not commands. `ApplicationLifecycleMonitor` owns AppKit/macOS lifecycle ingress and writes the lifecycle stores; it does not route workspace commands.

## Prior Art

| Project | Pattern Used | What We Took |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Supacode** (supabitapp/supacode) | GhosttySurfaceBridge per surface, ~40 @Observable properties on flat GhosttySurfaceState, TCA TerminalClient dependency, 8-category action handlers | Bridge-per-surface pattern, exhaustive action handling, @Observable state for UI binding |
| **cmux** (manaflow-ai/cmux) | WebSocket PTY server, typed ServerEvent broadcast, server-authoritative state | Event broadcast model, typed event dispatch |
| **Zed** (zed-industries/zed) | Entity/component system (gpui), event log with total ordering, deterministic replay, per-entity error isolation | Single event log (not three planes), bounded replay for late-joining consumers, per-pane error isolation |
| **VS Code** | Extension host process isolation, RPC command dispatch, incremental state updates | Command ID + async result pattern, RPC dispatch model. NOTE: VS Code uses shared runtime per pane type; we chose per-pane instances instead (D1, A2). |
