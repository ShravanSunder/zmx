# AppKit + SwiftUI Hybrid Architecture

## TL;DR

Agent Studio uses an **AppKit-main** architecture hosting SwiftUI views for declarative UI. AppKit controls the window lifecycle, responder chain, and terminal surface management. SwiftUI handles forms, lists, and animations. State is distributed across independent `@Observable` stores (Jotai-style) with `private(set)` for unidirectional flow (Valtio-style). A coordinator sequences cross-store operations. See [Component Architecture](component_architecture.md) for the full data model and service layer.

## Architectural Philosophy
Agent Studio follows an **AppKit-main** architecture. This decision was made to ensure direct control over the macOS system integration while leveraging SwiftUI's strengths for declarative UI components.

### Why AppKit-first?
- **Direct Lifecycle Control**: AppDelegate and main NSApplication provide a predictable, standard macOS lifecycle.
- **Better Key Handling**: Native AppKit responder chain management for complex terminal keyboard shortcuts and global key monitoring.
- **Less Glue Code**: Avoids the "wrapper struct → representable → coordinator" ceremony for core system features like menus, windows, and traffic lights.
- **Performance**: Direct access to NSWindow and NSView for performance-sensitive components like the terminal emulator shell.

## Decision Matrix: AppKit vs. SwiftUI

| Use Case | Recommended Framework | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Windows & Lifecycle** | AppKit | Direct control over titlebars, traffic lights, and resize constraints. |
| **Global Key Monitoring** | AppKit | More robust and standard implementation via the responder chain. |
| **Complex Menus** | AppKit / NSHostingMenu | Better integration with standard macOS menu behaviors. |
| **Forms & Settings** | SwiftUI | Declarative style saves significant time for standard layouts. |
| **Dynamic Lists** | SwiftUI | `List` and `ForEach` are much more efficient to implement than `NSTableView`. |
| **Animations** | SwiftUI | Modern animation APIs are far superior to AppKit's legacy systems. |

## Core Hosting Patterns

### NSHostingController
Use for full-screen components, sidebars, or major view controller containment.
```swift
let sidebar = NSHostingController(rootView: SidebarView())
// Add as child view controller
self.addChild(sidebar)
self.view.addSubview(sidebar.view)
```

### NSHostingView
Use for granular embedding within existing `NSView` hierarchies (e.g., custom cells, small UI widgets).
```swift
let host = NSHostingView(rootView: SmallWidget())
parentView.addSubview(host)
```

### NSHostingMenu (macOS 14.4+)
Use for modern, declarative menu construction.
```swift
let menu = NSHostingMenu(rootView: MenuView())
```

## Sizing & Layout
- **Intrinsic Size**: SwiftUI views automatically update Auto Layout constraints based on their content size.
- **Flexible Sizing**: Use `.frame(minWidth:idealWidth:maxWidth:)` in SwiftUI to inform AppKit's layout system.
- **Constraint Management**: For `NSHostingController`, set `sizingOptions` (e.g., `.intrinsicContentSize`) to control how the view interacts with its container.

## Data Flow & State

The full data model, service layer, and mutation pipeline are documented in [Component Architecture](component_architecture.md). Key patterns relevant to the AppKit+SwiftUI boundary:

- **Atomic stores**: `WorkspaceStore`, `SurfaceManager`, `SessionRuntime` — each `@Observable @MainActor`, each owns one domain. All state is `private(set)` for unidirectional flow. SwiftUI views observe store properties automatically via `@Observable` property tracking. No `@Published`, no `objectWillChange`, no Combine subscriptions.
- **Coordinator**: `PaneCoordinator` sequences cross-store operations (e.g., close tab touches `WorkspaceStore` + `SurfaceManager` + `SessionRuntime`). Owns no domain state.
- **AppKit observation**: Non-SwiftUI code (e.g., `TabBarAdapter`) bridges to `@Observable` using `withObservationTracking` with re-registration pattern.
- **Event transport**: New plumbing uses `AsyncStream` + `swift-async-algorithms`. Existing `NotificationCenter` for AppKit menu actions migrated incrementally.

### NSHostingView → SwiftUI Root Mapping

Each AppKit controller that hosts SwiftUI creates NSHostingView(s) **once** at setup time. @Observable drives all re-renders — no manual rootView replacement.

**PaneTabViewController** hosting regions:
| NSHostingView | SwiftUI Root | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `tabBarHostingView` | `CustomTabBar` | Tab bar (top strip) |
| `splitHostingView` | `ActiveTabContent` → `TerminalSplitContainer` | Main content area — renders the active tab's split tree via `PaneLeafContainer` leaves |
| `arrangementButtonHostingView` | `ArrangementFloatingButton` | Floating arrangement button |
| _(pure AppKit)_ | `emptyStateView` | Empty state when no tabs exist |

**MainSplitViewController**:
| NSHostingController | SwiftUI Root | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Sidebar hosting controller | `SidebarViewWrapper` → `SidebarContentView` | Worktree/repo sidebar |

**CommandBarPanelController**:
| NSHostingView | SwiftUI Root | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Panel hosting view | `CommandBarView` | Command palette UI |

### Ownership Hierarchy

Services are created in `AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching()` in dependency order:

```
AppDelegate
├── WorkspaceStore      ← @Observable, restore from disk
├── SessionRuntime      ← runtime health tracking
├── ViewRegistry        ← paneId → NSView mapping (not @Observable)
├── PaneCoordinator     ← action dispatch + model↔view↔surface orchestration
├── TabBarAdapter       ← bridges @Observable store via withObservationTracking
├── CommandBarPanelController ← command bar lifecycle (⌘P/⌘⇧P/⌘⌥P)
└── MainWindowController
    └── MainSplitViewController
        └── PaneTabViewController
```

See [Component Architecture — Service Layer](component_architecture.md#3-service-layer) for detailed descriptions of each service.

### Split Drag Interaction Path

Management-mode split insertion is coordinated at the tab container level:

- `PaneLeafContainer` renders pane content and controls uniformly for all pane kinds.
- `PaneFramePreferenceKey` reports pane frames in `tabContainer` coordinates.
- `SplitContainerDropDelegate` resolves drag location using `PaneDragCoordinator` and submits validated drop actions through existing `PaneActionCommand` flow.
- `PaneDropTargetOverlay` renders the active destination marker from `PaneDropTarget` + `DropZone`.

This keeps split targeting pane-type-agnostic (terminal/webview/bridge/future panes).

## Swift 6 Concurrency

Swift 6.2 toolchain, `.swiftLanguageMode(.v6)`, macOS 26. Data-race safety is enforced — Sendable violations are compilation errors. Research via DeepWiki (`swiftlang/swift-evolution`) before guessing at concurrency patterns.

### Rules

**Do:**

- **`Task { }` inherits actor isolation** (SE-0304, SE-0420, SE-0431). Inside a `@MainActor` method, the Task body runs on MainActor. Access stored properties directly — no `await` needed.
- **`isolated deinit` for `@MainActor` classes** (SE-0371, Swift 6.2). Access stored properties, cancel Tasks, finish continuations directly.
- **`AsyncStream.makeStream(of:)` for new code** (SE-0388, Swift 5.9+). Returns `(stream, continuation)` tuple.
- **`@preconcurrency import`** for frameworks that haven't fully adopted Sendable.

**Don't:**

- **Prefer `@concurrent nonisolated` over `Task.detached { }`** (project policy) — `Task.detached` strips task priority and task-locals. `@concurrent nonisolated` helpers (Swift 6.2, SE-0461) preserve structured concurrency and priority inheritance. In `@MainActor` types, helpers must opt out of actor isolation (`nonisolated`) before using `@concurrent`; project convention is `static` helpers to avoid accidental `self` capture. Exception: `Task.detached` is still appropriate when you need to escape structured concurrency scope or intentionally strip task-locals.
- **No `MainActor.assumeIsolated { }` in deinit** — use `isolated deinit` instead (SE-0414 makes `assumeIsolated` problematic with non-Sendable types). Note: `assumeIsolated` is valid in synchronous C callback trampolines where you can prove you're on MainActor but the compiler can't see it — this restriction is specifically about deinit.
- **No plain `deinit` accessing non-Sendable `@MainActor` stored properties** — compilation error. Use `isolated deinit`.
- **Prefer `isolated deinit` over `@MainActor deinit`** — both are valid (SE-0371 allows global actor annotations on deinit), but `isolated deinit` is more generic and works for any actor type.
- **No `nonisolated(unsafe)`** without a comment explaining why it's necessary and safe.

### Correct Patterns

**Task isolation — safe, do not flag in reviews:**

```swift
@MainActor
final class Foo {
    private var buffer: [Int] = []

    func start() {
        // Task inherits @MainActor from enclosing context (SE-0304).
        // buffer access is on MainActor — no await needed.
        Task { [weak self] in
            while let self, !self.buffer.isEmpty {
                try? await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(16))
                self.flush()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**`isolated deinit` — required for `@MainActor` classes accessing non-Sendable stored properties:**

```swift
@MainActor
final class StreamOwner {
    private var timer: Task<Void, Never>?
    private let continuation: AsyncStream<Int>.Continuation

    // Runs on MainActor. Safe to access all stored properties.
    // Both `isolated deinit` and `@MainActor deinit` are valid (SE-0371),
    // but `isolated deinit` is preferred — it's more generic across actor types.
    isolated deinit {
        timer?.cancel()
        continuation.finish()
    }
}
```

**Note:** Nonisolated `deinit` can still access stored properties that have `Sendable` types (both `let` and `var`). The compilation error only occurs for non-Sendable stored properties. `Task<Void, Never>` and `AsyncStream.Continuation` are Sendable, but `isolated deinit` is still preferred for clarity and forward safety.

**AsyncStream creation — both patterns are safe:**

```swift
// Synchronous closure pattern (existing code, safe).
// The build closure executes synchronously — cont is always set before the unwrap.
var cont: AsyncStream<T>.Continuation?
let stream = AsyncStream<T> { cont = $0 }
let continuation = cont!

// makeStream factory (preferred for new code).
let (stream, continuation) = AsyncStream.makeStream(of: T.self)
```

`AsyncStream.Continuation` is `Sendable` — `yield()` and `finish()` are safe from any isolation context, including `isolated deinit`.

### Common False Positives

Agents reviewing Swift concurrency code must not flag these as bugs:

| Pattern | Why it's safe |
|---------|--------------|
| `Task { [weak self] in self?.prop }` in `@MainActor` method | Task inherits MainActor isolation (SE-0304) |
| `cont!` after `AsyncStream<T> { cont = $0 }` | Build closure is synchronous — cont is always set |
| `continuation.finish()` in `isolated deinit` | Continuation is Sendable, deinit runs on actor |
| Events emitted during `.draining` lifecycle | `.draining` is the lifecycle state where a runtime flushes remaining events before transitioning to `.terminated`. Events during draining are intentional — see [Contract 5](pane_runtime_architecture.md#contract-5-panelifecyclestatemachine). |
| `[weak self]` + `while let self` loop in Task | Strong ref held per iteration, released between iterations — no retain cycle |
| `DispatchQueue.main.async` in NSView subclasses | These classes are already `@MainActor`. The dispatch is redundant but compiles. Tracked as SwiftLint warnings for LUNA-325 migration — not a correctness bug. |

### SE Proposal Quick Reference

| Proposal | What it governs | Key rule |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| SE-0304 | Task isolation inheritance | `Task { }` inherits actor; `Task.detached { }` does not |
| SE-0371 | `isolated deinit` | Runs deinit on owning actor's executor (Swift 6.2) |
| SE-0388 | `AsyncStream.makeStream` | Factory returning `(stream, continuation)` tuple (Swift 5.9) |
| SE-0420 | Isolation inheritance refinement | Clarified `@_inheritActorContext` semantics for Task/TaskGroup |
| SE-0431 | `@isolated(any)` function types | Task.init uses `@isolated(any)` for correct executor enqueue |
| SE-0461 | `@concurrent` / `nonisolated(nonsending)` | `nonisolated async` inherits caller isolation by default (Swift 6.2); use `@concurrent` to explicitly run on cooperative pool |

## AppKit Event Handling in Hybrid Views

When adding drag-to-reorder to SwiftUI views hosted in AppKit, use gesture recognizers rather than overriding `hitTest`. This lets SwiftUI handle all normal interactions while AppKit intercepts only drag gestures.

### Recommended: NSPanGestureRecognizer

```swift
class DraggableHostingView: NSView, NSDraggingSource {
    private var panGesture: NSPanGestureRecognizer!
    private var panStartItemId: UUID?

    override init(frame: NSRect) {
        super.init(frame: frame)
        panGesture = NSPanGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handlePan(_:)))
        panGesture.delaysPrimaryMouseButtonEvents = false
        addGestureRecognizer(panGesture)
    }

    @objc private func handlePan(_ gesture: NSPanGestureRecognizer) {
        let location = gesture.location(in: self)
        switch gesture.state {
        case .began:
            panStartItemId = itemAtPoint(location)
        case .changed:
            if let itemId = panStartItemId, !isDragging {
                startDrag(itemId: itemId, event: NSApp.currentEvent!)
                panStartItemId = nil
            }
        case .ended, .cancelled:
            panStartItemId = nil
        default: break
        }
    }
}
```

**Why this works:**
- SwiftUI receives all clicks, hovers, right-clicks normally
- Pan gesture only fires after sufficient movement
- No event ownership conflicts

### Avoid: hitTest Override

Overriding `hitTest` to claim events creates problems:
- Breaks SwiftUI's event handling (close buttons, context menus)
- Risk of infinite loops if events are forwarded back to subviews
- Requires reimplementing click handling manually

### Reference Implementation

See `DraggableTabBarHostingView.swift` for the gesture recognizer pattern applied to tab bar drag-to-reorder.

## Command Bar (⌘P)

The command bar is a keyboard-driven search/command palette modeled after Linear's ⌘K. It provides unified access to tabs, panes, commands, and worktrees through a single interface with prefix-based scoping.

### Architecture: NSPanel as Child Window

The command bar uses an `NSPanel` (child window) rather than a SwiftUI overlay. This guarantees:

- **Z-ordering** above all AppKit terminal views (Ghostty surfaces are `NSView` subclasses)
- **Clean first-responder management** — the search field gets focus; the terminal releases it
- **Click-outside-to-dismiss** via backdrop `NSView` overlay on the parent window
- **Native backdrop blur** via `NSVisualEffectView` with `.sidebar` material

```
MainWindow
├── MainSplitViewController (all existing content)
│   ├── Sidebar
│   └── PaneTabViewController
│
├── CommandBarBackdropView (NSView overlay, click to dismiss)
│
└── CommandBarPanel (NSPanel, child window)
    ├── NSVisualEffectView (.sidebar material)
    └── NSHostingView
        └── CommandBarView (SwiftUI)
            ├── CommandBarScopePill
            ├── CommandBarSearchField
            ├── CommandBarResultsList
            └── CommandBarFooter
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Three shortcuts open the same command bar with different prefix scoping:

| Shortcut | Prefix | Scope |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `⌘P` | _(none)_ | Everything — tabs, panes, commands, worktrees |
| `⌘⇧P` | `>` | Commands only, grouped by category |
| `⌘⌥P` | `@` | Panes and tabs, grouped by parent tab |

Shortcuts are registered as menu items in `AppDelegate` (responder chain routing). Pressing the same shortcut again while the bar is open toggles it closed. Pressing a different shortcut while open switches the prefix in-place.

### Keyboard Interception

`CommandBarTextField` is an `NSViewRepresentable` wrapping `NSTextField` to intercept keys that SwiftUI's `TextField` doesn't expose:

| Key | Selector | Action |
|-----|----------|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | `moveUp:` / `moveDown:` | Move selection (wraps at boundaries) |
| `↩` | `insertNewline:` | Execute selected item or drill into children |
| `⎋` | `cancelOperation:` | Dismiss entirely (routed through panel's `onDismiss`) |
| `⌫` on empty | `deleteBackward:` | Pop nested level or clear prefix |

### Focus Management

1. **On show**: `CommandBarPanel.makeKeyAndOrderFront()` → search field becomes first responder
2. **During**: Terminal surface loses first responder (Ghostty handles this gracefully)
3. **On dismiss**: `parentWindow.makeKeyAndOrderFront()` → terminal regains focus

### Execution Flow

The command bar never mutates `WorkspaceStore` directly. All actions flow through the existing validation pipeline:

```
CommandBarView.executeItem()
  ├── .dispatch(command)         → CommandDispatcher.dispatch() → full pipeline
  ├── .dispatchTargeted(cmd,id)  → CommandDispatcher.dispatch(_:target:targetType:)
  ├── .navigate(level)           → state.pushLevel() (nested drill-in)
  └── .custom(closure)           → Direct execution (e.g., tab switching via Notification)
```

### Key Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `CommandBarPanelController` | Lifecycle: show/dismiss/toggle, backdrop, animation, state ownership |
| `CommandBarState` | Observable state: visibility, prefix parsing, navigation stack, selection, recents |
| `CommandBarDataSource` | Builds `CommandBarItem` arrays from `WorkspaceStore` + `CommandDispatcher` |
| `CommandBarSearch` | Custom fuzzy matching with score + character match ranges for highlighting |
| `CommandBarPanel` | `NSPanel` subclass with `NSVisualEffectView` and `NSHostingView` |
| `CommandBarView` | Root SwiftUI view composing search, results, scope pill, footer |

## Ghostty Terminal Integration

For the Ghostty surface lifecycle, ownership model, state machine, and health monitoring, see:

**[Ghostty Surface Architecture](ghostty_surface_architecture.md)**

## Session Restore

Terminal session state is managed by `WorkspaceStore` (persistence) and `SessionRuntime` (health/lifecycle). `PaneCoordinator` is the active intermediary for surface and runtime orchestration — views never call `SurfaceManager` or `SessionRuntime` directly. The zmx backend (`ZmxBackend`) provides session persistence across app restarts via raw byte passthrough daemons.

For the full session lifecycle, restore flow, and zmx configuration, see: **[Session Lifecycle](session_lifecycle.md)**
